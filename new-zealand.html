    "description": "Should you always push the handbrake button? People say don\u2019t yank the hand brake without pushing the button. Let\u2019s pull back the covers on this  myth. When you pull up on the hand brake, this pulls on a cable. This cable forces pressure to be applied to the rear brake pads, locking the wheel. The hand brake uses a ratcheting mechanism, so as you pull it up, the pawl clicks along the gear teeth until you stop pulling, where it\u2019s held in pace by the nearest gear tooth. The button is simply there to release the pawl away from the gear, so you can disengage the parking brake. So it\u2019s two robust metal parts, with very little speed between them, and thus negligible friction and wear generated. But to be safe, I stopped using my car entirely and now just walk, so that my parking brake doesn\u2019t wear out. \n\nFull Handbrake Video - https://youtu.be/1ePcNfx1UEw\n\nSubscribe to Engineering Explained for more videos! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7\nRecommended Books & Car Products - http://amzn.to/2BrekJm\n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA",

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
