Led by the reluctant hero Captain Zoom, the team searches for young recruits who might save the world\u2014or at least survive training camp! \ud83d\ude04\r\rWatch as each kid reveals their quirky and sometimes unpredictable powers. Some impress, some cause a few laughs (and minor explosions), but all of them have something special. It's a chaotic mix of chaos, comedy, and surprising moments of heart. \u2764\ufe0f\r\rWhether you're here for the action, the laughs, or the nostalgia of early 2000s superhero films, this scene is a must-watch. Don\u2019t forget to like \ud83d\udc4d, comment \ud83d\udde8\ufe0f, and subscribe for more Zoom Academy highlights and superhero throwbacks! \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Lady failed to yield and i couldnt brake in time, she was deemed 100% at fault and i am currently working on getting physical and motorcycle damages taken care of but the Z is most likely totaled. But thank god i was able to walk away with just a broken arm, gopro saved me from slamming my helmet on to the ground. No road rash or any other injuries. This happened in Riverview FL.\"",

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
