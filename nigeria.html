<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
