Lady failed to yield and i couldnt brake in time, she was deemed 100% at fault and i am currently working on getting physical and motorcycle damages taken care of but the Z is most likely totaled. But thank god i was able to walk away with just a broken arm, gopro saved me from slamming my helmet on to the ground. No road rash or any other injuries. This happened in Riverview FL.\"",

Led by the reluctant hero Captain Zoom, the team searches for young recruits who might save the world—or at least survive training camp! 😄\r\rWatch as each kid reveals their quirky and sometimes unpredictable powers. Some impress, some cause a few laughs (and minor explosions), but all of them have something special. It's a chaotic mix of chaos, comedy, and surprising moments of heart. ❤️\r\rWhether you're here for the action, the laughs, or the nostalgia of early 2000s superhero films, this scene is a must-watch.
