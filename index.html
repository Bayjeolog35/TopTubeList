    "description": "You’re being tossed into the buggiest season yet with Fortnite’s Battle Royale Chapter 6, Season 4: Shock ’N Awesome!

The bugs out there? Vicious, relentless, swarming. The Island is an absolute mess of goopy nests and egg sacs. Prepare to stomp and smash the swarm with the O.X.R., the Island’s anti-bug military defense force.

If you’re serious about stomping roachies, then you’ll want to pick up new weapons issues by O.X.R. ike the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver, or the laser-guided Swarmstrike rocket launcher.

And don’t forget about leveling up with the Shock ‘N Awesome Battle Pass to knock the socks off the swarm with style! New Outfits include:

UNSC Spartan
Yoo-mi
Agent Patch
Battle Gamer Mae
Lt. Ripp Slade
Onyx Winter
Green Ranger

Time to pelt pests, eliminating opposing enemies, and loot those Chests.

Good luck out there, soldier!",

    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?

From Oscar® winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).

Former college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.

Just when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.

The film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.

HIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw’s Kate Oh.

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

🎤Lyrics:  Three Days Grace - I Hate Everything About You

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Every roommate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet

Only when I stop to think about it

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know?

I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?

I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?

Saitama is a hero who only became a hero for fun. After three years of “special training,” he’s become so strong that he’s practically invincible. In fact, he’s too strong—even his mightiest opponents are taken out with a single punch. Alongside Genos, his faithful disciple, Saitama performs his official hero duties as a member of the Hero Association. One day, monsters claiming to be from the Monster Association suddenly appeared, taking a child of Hero Association executive hostage. The S-class heroes gather and plan a raid on the Monster Association hideout to rescue the hostage. Meanwhile, Garou, a “human monster” who was taken by the Monster Association during a battle with the heroes, awakens in the Monster Association hideout.\"

LETRA/LYRIC:🎵
Baby, me vuelves loco
No se esperó al hotel
Y arriba del Merced
Mirándome a los ojos

Hazme tuyo otra vez
Por última vez
Sabe que estoy loco
Pedí el tusi por cel
No la llevé a Chanel
Quería probarme un poco
Ya le quité el antojo

Tragos de Henny loco
Ya van a dar la seis
Y arriba de tu piel, quiero pegarme un polvo
Y chingarte bien coco

¿Baby, qué más?
¿Qué fue?
¿Qué tal si por la noche apagamos los dos el cel?
Bebé
Bien chula y, apartе de todo, tú eres niña biеn
¡Qué onda!

Y así suena el amor de la calle, baby
Ey, ey, ey
Que sigan llegando las pacas, carnal
La verdadera presión
Nací en el 2 y el 4, viejo
Fuerza Regida, viejo
Y, como siempre, pariente

Chula, préndeme el porro
Maquillate otra vez
No vayan a saber lo que te hace este cholo
Contéstale a ese wey, dile que todo bien

Mami, borra las fotos
Que tomamos ayer, sin ropa, en el motel
Con las luces en rojo
Barbie modelo porno

Qué ojos, qué piel, qué rollo
El diablo hecho mujer, por ti, me porto bien
Todita, te conozco
Hasta mejor que el tonto

¿Baby, qué más?
¿Qué fue?
¿Qué tal si por la noche apagamos los dos el cel?
Bebé
Bien chula y, aparte de todo, tú eres niña bien
¡Qué onda!

(¿Qué tal si por la noche apagamos los dos el cel?)
(Bebé)
(¡Qué onda!)

    "description": "Before Freakier Friday zaps into theaters, revisit the original film that feels like it probably should have stayed on the Disney Channel. Not that that’s necessarily a bad thing! We F with The Suite Life, and this one is good as far as body switch comedies go! It’s just, like, man did parts of this not age well, and I’m not talking about Lindsey Lohan. You’ll see…

Comment below with who YOU’D like to switch bodies with in an early 2000’s PG comedy

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
