Lyrics:
It’s so silly of me to act like I don’t need you bad
When all, all I can think about is us since I seen you last I know I didn't have to walk away
All I had to do was ask for space
I’m telling you, be on your way
When I told you to fall back

So can you come pick up your clothes I have them folded Meet me at the door while it’s still open
I know it’s getting cold out, but it’s not frozen
So come pick up your clothes I have them folded

I’ll let your body decide if this is good enough for you Already folding it for you
Already folding it for you
I’ll let your body decide if this is good enough for you Already folding it for you
Already folded up for you

No matter what you do to switch the story up, I know I made my mark And I would still choose you through it all
That’s the crazy part (crazy part)
I don't need no more empty promises
Promise me that you got it
I don't need roses
Just need some flowers from my garden
Can’t you go back to how you loved on me when you started?
I’ll be here begging for ya
You should be giving me love all damn day
‘Til the day is done
So if you wanna go that way, I’ll be waiting on

For you to come pick up your clothes I have them folded Meet me at the door while it’s still open
I know it’s getting cold out, but it’s not frozen
So come pick up your clothes I have them folded
So come pick up your clothes I have them folded
Meet me at the door while it’s still open
I know it’s getting cold out, but tell me that it’s not frozen So come pick up your clothes I have them folded

I’ll let your body decide if this is good enough for you Already folded it for you
Already folding up for

The official YouTube channel of Atlantic Records artist Kehlani.

It doesn’t really need an explanation—you know exactly what Kehlani means when she sings. Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” 

Along the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.

    "description": "🧛 Half human, half vampire, you know his name — Blade. 
 
Almost a century ago, Eric Brooks was born of two worlds: the light of his mother's embrace and the dark of the vampire that attacked her. After embracing his existence as a dhampir, he became the Daywalker, the ultimate vampire hunter, combining unmatched combat skills and unwavering supernatural abilities. 
 
When Dracula reigned over New York City, it was none other than Blade who confronted him first. By then, however, it was too late. Dracula had mastered the almighty power of Chronovium, defeating the Daywalker and imprisoning him within the castle dungeon. 
 
After Dracula's fall, Blade was sent to Wakanda to recover, but his story is far from over. Now recruited by Shuri to save all existence, Blade stands awake and at the ready against the dark forces of Hela and Knull.

Lyrics:
Lets Get It

Zombie in that bullet proof wit dirty semi
Ain’t never play wit me and live these niggas all lies

Foxes in that Track Hawk not no fucking Hemi
I get you hit around the world because this Mob Ties

Beat it up to sleep that's only if you let me
Just let the Zombie take the lead I eat it up alive

Pull up on the scene inside that brand new Bentley

And only pretty bitch and killers jump inside the ride
Since you wanna get naughty I punish you

They want war with the Zombie it's time to dance
Won’t believe what this money and power do

Any bitch that I want coming out them pants
She so sweet honey glazed just like Winnie Pooh

Wanna hit Nikki Beach just to get a tan
He ain’t bust down your wrist buy new bags for you

How you say that’s your man I don’t understand
Get you AP baby blow my whole advance

Hunnid at the jeweler fifty both my hand
Clutching on my switchy but it’s just my fans

Since Nardy left you just been out here taking hard drugs

Take off in that rocket still ain’t never land
Just two hundred K away from M&M
I just spent a ten on Louis denim man

They turnt they back but it's my fault for trying to buy love
Oohh

Lieutenant Z keep sending blitzes like he Biden
The tank on full so get on top and come and ride them

Get thirty just to hit the stage make sure it's Paid in Full
She tell me put my gun away don’t like no violence

I kill that pussy leave the scene when I hear sirens

I swing the stick like a guitar I play the violence

Just had to vent don’t want no fame ain’t know I’ll be a rapper

I press these Perkys sell a thousand of em to the Pastor

Head nappy gun showin baggie clothes
She still gave me the pussy

This shit I just overcame they ain’t have a choice
Make me Big Homie

If the price where I'm from it’s mandatory
They sleep in ya in bushes

I got nigga that drop they guns with buttons and pick up butchers
Free them

Half my niggas and some my aunties got sum in common
They love cooking

About my fucking name I got niggas that’s ready to line ya
And do a twenty

She find a family bitch strip for gold
Went to sleep jewelry show and she gone

I ain’t gone lie I ain’t got love for Holmes
I ain’t gone lie I got love for hoes

You ain’t good for my soul bitch roll
Free Shiesty Fox wiped his nose

Hit everybody fuck it kill the code
I let my hoes spend the night in my clothes

Every fucking show I do before I done brought my crew
Wham Whammy

I put Cheez on one dude
My Z done killed they whole crew

Everytime they said they hit at me
That shit was old news

Niggas cap everytime
These niggas watch my page they watch my hoes too

I just can’t get enough of niggas
I just can’t get rid of these niggas

Lil bro num got a box of switches
I just bought a box of Lemonds

Fuck you boy I can’t pop it with you
He ain’t never see some pimpin

I got homeboys rich off pussy
The done pimp the meanest women

The opps wanna show love fuck em
Being a player don’t run in your blood for nothing

Shots fired then leave the club for plucking
Where I'm from they’ll kill your blood

Brudda and cousin

#Twinless

In Twinless, two young men meet in a twin support group and form an unlikely friendship. Roman (Dylan O'Brien) and Dennis (James Sweeney) both search for solace and an identity without their other halves and soon become inseparable outside the group. But when Roman meets Dennis’ ebullient co-worker, Marcie (Aisling Franciosi), all is revealed to be not what it seems, as each man harbors secrets that could unravel everything.",

Lyrics:

Pardesiya..
Hai tere pyar mein jab se
Jhankaar si..
Hai dil ke taar mein tab se

Tum ho mere jaanta hun magar
Pohchaauñ tum tak ye kaise khabar

Kab se hun main ummeed meiñ
Hai ankaha jo sun lo agar

Pardesiya..
Mila hai tu mujhe jab se

Maiñ qaid huñ
Tere bhi pyar mein tab se ..

Pardesiya haiñ teri batiyoñ ne 
Kiya pareshan pardesiya..

Pardesiya haiñ teri ankhiyoñ ke
Dil pe nishaan pardesiya..
 
Chhoo ke laboñ se jaise
Jaadu hi kar diya
Saavan ne morni ko
Qaabu mein kar liya

Hum dono ki juda theeñ hastiyaañ
Hoñ kinara bin jaise kashtiyaañ

Aasaan ho aage safar
Tum saath mera chun lo agar

Pardesiya..

💥 Letra:

[Intro: KAROL G & Becky G]
O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Salud, mami
Ah, ah, ah, ay

[Pre-Coro: Becky G & KAROL G]
Lo que no sirve que no estorbe
Te metiste autogol por torpe
Te quedó grande este torque
Ya no estoy pa' que de mí te enamores, baby (Chi)
Sin Visa ni pasaporte (No)
Mandé tu falso amor de vacaciones (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Pa' la mierda y nunca vuelvas
Que todo se te devuelva, no
De lo que me hiciste si no te acuerda'

[Coro: KAROL G & Becky G]
No me vuelvas a llamar, que hasta boté el cеlular
De lo tóxico que erеs, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (Chi)

[Verso 1: Becky G]
Llegué pa'l party, saca la botella
La que te quería, no sé quién es ella
Te dejé el review, no te puse ni una estrella
Y te olvidé porque no dejaste huella
Ya no miro pa'trás, ni pa' parquearme
Tengo a uno que está listo pa' llevarme
El segundo está esperando en el hotel
Y el tercero lo conozco esta noche (No, no)
No me llames, que mi número cambié (Cambié)
Si quieres que te lo dé (Dé)
Llama 1-800-jódete
No sé si me escuchaste
No me llames, que mi número cambié (Cambié)
Si quieres que te lo dé (Dé)
Llama 1-800-jódete (Jódete)

[Coro: Becky G & KAROL G]
No me vuelvas a llamar, hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va, ah-ah
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más (Ey)

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Becky G]
Ay, yo lo lamento (Ah)
Tu' gana' de volver (Ey) murieron en el intento (Ah)
Lo hiciste ver como que perdiste el tiempo
Quedaste bien porque lo mío ni lo cuento (Papi)
Te veo en la' rede', no puedo creerlo, qué pena de ti (Pena de ti)
Yo que fui buena y tú qué gonorrea pagándome así (Nea, qué gonorrea)
Rata de dos patas, lo dijo Paquita
Un animal rastrero (Jaja)
Que se come todo lo que se atraviesa
Diablo, tú ere' un cuero (Cuero)
No digas \"te quiero\", mejor sé sincero (Ey)
No digas \"te amo\" (Ah) porque eso fue en vano (Ah)
Llorando estaba' tú y como no te salí
Andas comiéndote a otra, pero estás pensando en mí (Chi)

[Coro: Becky G & KAROL G, Becky G]
No me vuelvas a llamar, hasta boté el celular
De lo tóxico que eres, se volvió perjudicial
Lo que se va, se va, ah-ah
Conmigo no te equivoques
De lo tóxico que eres, no te quiero ver más

[Outro: Becky G & KAROL G]
Ouh
Repítelo, mami
\"Que a veces no te cambian por algo mejor
Y ni siquiera por algo más rico\"
KAROL G y Becky G
It's the real G's, baby (Jaja)
Ovy On The Drums

    "description": "🚶‍♂️ THE LONG WALK – Final Trailer (2025) | Stephen King Adaptation 🔥
Only one can survive the walk. From the twisted mind of Stephen King comes The Long Walk — a chilling dystopian thriller brought to life in this long-awaited cinematic adaptation. Witness the psychological and physical unraveling of 100 teenage boys forced to walk until only one remains — or die trying.

🎬 Film Overview:
In a near-future America ruled by a totalitarian regime, a brutal annual contest known as The Long Walk pits 100 teenage participants against one another in a harrowing test of endurance. The rules are simple: Keep walking above 4 mph. Stop three times — and you're eliminated… permanently. As the miles stretch on and friendships turn to rivalries, survival becomes a psychological warzone.

🎥 Genre: Dystopian | Thriller | Drama | Psychological

Lyrics:
I was a ghost
I was alone (Hah)
Eo-du-wojin (Hah)
Ap-gil-sok-e (Ah)
Given the throne
I didn’t know
How to believe
I was the queen that I’m meant to be

I lived two lives
Tried to play both sides
But I couldn’t find my own place

Called a problem child
‘Cause I got too wild
But now that’s how I’m getting paid
Kkeut-eop-si

I’m done hiding now I’m shining like I’m born to be
We dreamin’ hard
We came so far
Now I believe

We’re goin’
Up, up, up
It’s our moment
You know together we’re glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Ohhh, up, up, up
With our voices
Yeong-won-h kkae-jil-su-eop-neun
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, I’m done hiding now I’m shining like I’m born to be
Oh, our time, no fear, no lies, that’s who we’re born to be

Waited so long to break these walls down
To wake up and feel like me
Put these patterns all in the past now
And finally live like the girl they all see
No more hiding, I’ll be shining
Like I’m born to be
‘Cause we are hunters, voices strong
And I know I believe

We’re goin’
Up, up, up
It’s our moment
You know together we’re glowing
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Ohhh, up, up, up
With our voices
Yeong-won-h kkae-jil-su-eop-neun
Gonna be, gonna be golden
Oh, I’m done hiding now I’m shining like I’m born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies, that’s who we’re born to be

You know we’re 
Gonna be, gonna be golden
We’re gonna be, gonna be
Born to be, born to be glowin’
Bal-kke bit-na-neuin u-ri
You know that it’s our time, no fears, no lies, that’s who we’re born to be

Oh, endless shine, undying light, that’s who we’re born to be
Oh, our time, no fears, no lies, that’s who we’re born to be

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Times have changed and times are strange
Here I come, but I ain't the same
Mama, I'm coming home
Time's gone by, it seems to be
You could have been a better friend to me
Mama, I'm coming home

[Pre-Chorus]
You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

[Verse 2]
You made me cry, you told me lies
But I can't stand to say goodbye
Mama, I'm coming home
I could be right, I could be wrong
It hurts so bad, it's been so long
Mama, I'm coming home

[Pre-Chorus]
Selfish love, yeah, we're both alone
The ride before the fall, yeah
But I'm gonna take this heart of stone
I've just got to have it all

[Chorus]
I've seen your face a hundred times
Every day we've been apart
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
'Cause Mama, Mama, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You took me in and you drove me out
Yeah, you had me hypnotized, yeah
Lost and found and turned around
By the fire in your eyes

[Chorus]
I've seen your face a thousand times
Every day we've been apart
I don't care about the sunshine, yeah
'Cause Mama, Mama, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home",

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Out on the streets, I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in

[Pre-Chorus]
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them, I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

[Verse 2]
Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reasons
I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason

[Pre-Chorus]
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

[Chorus]
But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Nothing that you can do
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

[Outro]
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark
Just a shot in the dark",

Watch This: \"TOP GUN 3 – Fan-Made Concept Trailer\"

The skies are calling one last time.

In this high-octane fan-made concept trailer, Top Gun 3 imagines the return of Tom Cruise as the legendary Maverick, now mentoring a new generation of elite pilots while facing the most dangerous mission of his career. With rising tensions, advanced enemy technology, and ghosts of the past resurfacing, Maverick must push beyond his limits to defend the skies he once ruled.

Featuring pulse-pounding aerial combat, emotional stakes, and the spirit of the original films, this imagined third chapter soars as a tribute to the legacy of Top Gun—where courage, speed, and sacrifice collide at Mach 10.

Legends don’t fade. They fly.

🕴  John Wick: Chapter 5

Speculation is swirling online that John Wick: Chapter 5 could be on the horizon, with fan communities buzzing about Keanu Reeves potentially donning the black suit one last time. Though there’s been no formal confirmation from Lionsgate or the actor himself, various breadcrumbs dropped in recent months have reignited hope for a continuation of the legendary assassin’s story.

Following the ambiguous ending of Chapter 4, where Wick is presumed dead — yet suspiciously off-screen — fans have theorized that the Baba Yaga may have faked his death to escape the High Table’s grasp. Some even believe this has been a long game, orchestrated with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), to dismantle the Table from the shadows.

Adding fuel to the fire, director Chad Stahelski recently mentioned in an interview that there are “more stories to be told in the Wick universe,” and fans were quick to point out that the word “chapter” implies an ongoing narrative rather than a definitive ending.

Letra:

[Verso 1]
Mi niña alista tu maleta ahorita
Quiero que te pongas bonita
Ya le marqué al pinche piloto, ya dile al tonto que ya te vas
Cabrona, buena pa' mentiras
Y esa boquita me fascina
Baby, tú eres para un loco, y como este loco no hay como yo

[Verso 2]
Qué bonito chingarte en las nubes, bandida
El piloto pura verga baja la mira
Terminamos en treinta y llegamos a Ibiza, aterrizamos sin prisa
Materiales son los que tú menos pedías
Los detalles enamoraron a mi niña
Hoy te dejo una cuenta de banco en las Islas, tú date vuelo

[Interludio]
Ah-ah
Uh

[Verso 3]
Qué bonita te miras, biеn mamacita sin calzón
No le cuentes a tu amiga quе la tengo como león
Calladita te ves más bonita
Pa' mirarnos otra vez, que no lo sepa tu güey
Sin pedos te espero, peléate con tu güey
Invéntate una razón pa' que no lo haga de pedo
Ni pedo, sin pedo, ¿ya qué? (Eh, eh, eh)

[Verso 4]
Qué bonito chingarte y más rico y de noche
Un palito en el aire y privado pa' Londres
Diferentes mujeres de varios sabores
Nomás no te me aloques
Mujeriego y coqueto, tengo mil amores
De hace tiempo te busco, mas no sé ni en dónde
Si me quieres, tendrás que aguantar los rumores
Nomás no te me aloques

[Outro]
Ey
Fuerza Regida
Jajaja
¿Ah?
Jaja

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
