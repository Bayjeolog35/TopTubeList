LYRICS
I saw your green hair
Beauty mark next to your mouth
There on the subway
I nearly had a breakdown
 
A few weeks later
Somebody wore your perfume
It almost killed me
I had to leave the room
 
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
It's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
It's never over
 
Til I don't look for you on the staircase
Or wish you thought that we were still soulmates
But I'm still counting down all of the days
Til you're just another girl on the subway
 
Made you the villain
Evil for just moving on
I see your shadow
I see it even with the lights off
I made a promise, if in four months this feeling ain't gone
Well, fuck this city! I'm movin' to Saskatchewan
 
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
Oh til its over
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
It's never over
 
Til I can break routine during foreplay
And trust myself that I won’t say your name
But I'm still counting down all of the days
Til you're just another girl on the subway
 
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
 
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
 
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
 
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
 
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
 
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
 
She’s got, she’s got a way
 
She’s got a way, she’s got a way
 
She got, she got away
 
She got away, she got away

Letra de Banda de Camión

Tú no te busca' cuarto' ni con la ubicación por GPS
A donde llego, hasta lo' generale' 'tán de pie
Tú priva' en vacanón y to' lo' día' andando a pie'
Yo sueno en Nueva York, en Guachupita y Lavapiés
La calle 'tá prendía' cada ve' que el loco tira
Y la mujere' mueven la' nalga' como Shakira
A lo' pariguayo' lo' mandamo' a hace' la fila
¿Tú me viene' a monta' pila y ni siquiera te depila'?
Tú no 'tá sonando, hay que ponerte par de pila'
Y en la discoteca suena El Alfa por pila
A donde llego la' mujere' a mí me miran pila
Toma ese palito y la mierda de chivo apila
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tam, que llegó el sicario
En la calle, culo' disponible' tengo vario'
Tu mujer me busca pa' que le rompa lo' ovario'
En el juego, tú ere' Luigi, pero yo soy Mario
Chofer, que me deje en la esquina, que me pasé
Cero coro con palomo', como debe se'
Ustede' tienen que besarme la mano y lo' pie'
La' mujere' beben de la blanca y se quitan la sed
Tengo verbo, cotorra, tigueraje y cutupla
Tú no 'tá sonando en la calle, pa' que te supla'
No te compare', que tú no ere' mi size
Doy lo' cuarto' en la calle como que e' un wifi

[Skit]
Ofrecome, pero a ese loco hay que darle banda
¿Pero de qué hay que darle banda?
¿De bicicleta? No
¿De carro? No
¿De avioneta? No
¿De barco de lo' que llegan al muelle? No
¿Pero de qué?

[Coro]
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión

[Post-Coro]
Dame, dame banda
Dame, dame banda
Dame, dame banda
Dame, dame banda

[Verso 2]
Yo pego nuevo' talento' en lo que dicen \"Berenjena\"
Pero con cotorra' de la' mía', nunca ajena'
Cadena falsifica', la medalla y el guillo
Yo tengo má' valor que lo' que mata'n a Trujillo
Él dice que él e' duro, ahí e' que yo me quillo
Como dicen lo' españole': \"Si me lo dejan, lo pillo\"
Tú me va' a llega' cuando deje de sali' el sol
O cuando jueguen tenis con pelota 'e basketball
Yo cruzo lo' peaje', manito, sin paga' toll
Si te pasa' conmigo, te llevo a visita' al doctor
Pero no El Dotol que trabaja en Alofoke
Si el dembow fuera un punto, yo soy el dueño del bloque",

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

Letra de la canción:
Pilla, hay ojos que no se hacen los ciegos
Porque las paredes no solo tienen oídos, ¿Oiste?
También tienen bemba

Siento que pronto me fallarás
Yo digo: “ver para creer”
Muchos me dicen que ya hay alguien más que te vieron por ahí con un tal “Estás loco marico. Ve a terapia”

Te siento distante, un poco arrogante, ya siento que no sentimos lo de antes, aunque yo de tu boca no sentimos nada
Si te pillo con el gyal, si te pillara…

Ay, ay, ay, si te pillara
Si te pillara, ay si te pillara
Si te pillara, ay si te pillara
Si te pillo los ojitos se me aguarán
Que alguien más te toque eso me asara, si tus labios pillo con otros, lloro

Si me mientes devuelve mi cora destrozado
Eso no aguanta esto me hace sentir desconfiado
Las ganas de verte a mi lado
Las digo en pasado
Perdí las esperanzas porque siento que me haces a un lado
Y sisaya pero cayaya, tu haciendo lo tuyo y yo aquí en la playa
Recuerdo tu boddy cuando guaya yeh me da nostalgia
Te extraño tanto ya no te siento
Duele tu decisión de dejarme en la nada
Si esto es real como están diciendo…
Me moriría si yo te pillara
You might also like
si mañana me muero

Y, ay, ay, si te pillara
Si te pillara, ay si te pillara
Si te pillara, ay si te pillara
Si te pillo los ojitos se me aguarán
Que alguien más te toque eso me asara, si tus labios pillo con otros lloro
Y, ay, ay, si te pillara
Si te pillara, ay si te pillara
Si te pillara, ay si te pillara
Si te pillo…

I'm back and I'm better (And I'm better)
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shawty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, \"Just listen\"

[Chorus]
Don't
Don't

[Verse 2]
Girl, said he keeps on playin' games
And his lovin' ain't the same
I don't know what to say, but
What a shame
If you were mine, you would not get the same
If you were mine, you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switchin' lanes
And that thing so fire, baby, no propane
Got good pussy, girl, can I be frank?
To keep it 100, girl, I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feelin' this way
Givin' you the world, baby, when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby, that's penetrate
Oh baby

[Chorus]
Don't

[Verse 3: King Vory]
H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Pour up, we can party some more
Yeah, got this drank in my cup
Got a young nigga feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
Young money got a nigga feelin' old
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Ride paint and we sip 'til we fold
H-Town got me feelin' so throwed
Spit fire in a world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed

[Chorus]
Don't",

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
