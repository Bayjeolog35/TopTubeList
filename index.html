LYRICS
I fell in love with a crazy bitch
She fucks me good 
She's a lunatic
Sut that's how I like my women

She keyed my truck
She stole my dog
She broke my heart 
Then I lost my job 
But that's only the beginning 

She's my future ex wife 
And we're moving real fast 
She's got me by the balls
She's a pain in my ass

But that's how I like my women 
Head spinnin' 
Round and round like an exorcism
It really turns me on 
That's how I like my ladies
Real crazy 
Bring it on cuz that shit don't phase me 
She might be 
Just a little crazier than me

I fell in love with a narcissist 
Her dad walked out and her mom's a bitch
She's psycho but that's a given 
(What's up Hardy!)
She's got a bible verse tatt'ed on her ass 
Never been to church 
Not to mention that                                                                                      
One more DUI sends her to prison 
(I love you)

But that's how I like my women 
Head spinnin' 
Round and round like an exorcism
It really turns me on 
That's how I like my ladies
Real crazy 
Bring it on cuz that shit don't phase me 
She might be
Just a little crazier than me

She's a little bit bipolar
She tells me that it's over
Then asks me to come over, again

She's my future ex wife 
and we're moving too fast 
She's got me by my balls
She's a pain in my ass

But that's how I like my women 
Head spinnin' 
Round and round like an exorcism
It really turns me on  
That's how I like my ladies
Real crazy 
Bring it on cuz that shit don't phase me 
She might be
Just a little crazier than you
She might be 
Just a little crazier than me

Lyrics

You think
I was born to ruin your life
But you did
Most of that before I arrived
Some things are broken when you open the box
So stop this, you’ve gone too far, enough is enough

I wish I didn’t care this much but I do
No one knows the half of it what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best 


Cause I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

Blame it on your history and say it’s not your fault
I can’t call you crazy cause you could be diagnosed
Oh I used to love you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

I wish you would look in the mirror cause if you did
You’d see the problem is you, cause you’re a prick
I know that I’m your scapegoat whenever the rain falls
Whenever you slip or when you’re in a dip
I was there to lean on when I was kid
But now that I’m an adult I see it for what it is
I have to lock the door now fuck building a bridge
Take all your apologies and put them in the bin

And for your Dad’s sake, please move out your Dad’s place
Stop bringing drama there with your mates 
Your sister’s got enough to manage on her plate
To worry ‘bout you controlling your rage
And one day we’ll all be dead
But between now and then
I never want to see you again

I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

Blame it on your history and say it’s not your fault
I can’t call you crazy cause you could be diagnosed
Oh I used to love you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more


I wish I didn’t care this much but I do
No one knows the half of it what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best 
But I don’t 

I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more 
Life got better when I lost you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

Blame it on your history and say it’s not your fault
I can’t call you crazy cause you could be diagnosed
Oh I used to love you 
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more",

    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?

From Oscar® winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).

Former college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.

Just when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.

The film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.

HIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw’s Kate Oh.

Lyrics: 
Can't help but notice, all of the ways 
In which I failed myself, I failed the world all the same 
I don't think I'm pretty, it's not up for debate 
A woman's best currency is her body, not her brain 

They try to tell me, tell me I'm wrong
But mirrors tell lies to me, my mind just plays along
The world is a sick place, at least for a girl
The people want beauty, skinny always wins
And I don't have enough of it, I'll never have enough of it 

Sometimes I see her, she looks like Snow White
She's everything I am but my wrongs are turned to rights 
Her body is smaller, skin is so fair
She's achieved everything I've dreamed of 
And it's all that I can think of 

They try to tell me, tell me I'm wrong 
But mirrors tell lies to me, my mind just plays along
The world is a sick place, at least for a girl
The people want beauty, skinny, always wins 
And I don't have enough of it, I'll never have enough of it",

The bugs out there? Vicious, relentless, swarming. The Island is an absolute mess of goopy nests and egg sacs. Prepare to stomp and smash the swarm with the O.X.R., the Island’s anti-bug military defense force.

If you’re serious about stomping roachies, then you’ll want to pick up new weapons issues by O.X.R. ike the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver, or the laser-guided Swarmstrike rocket launcher.

And don’t forget about leveling up with the Shock ‘N Awesome Battle Pass to knock the socks off the swarm with style! New Outfits include:

UNSC Spartan
Yoo-mi
Agent Patch
Battle Gamer Mae
Lt. Ripp Slade
Onyx Winter
Green Ranger

Time to pelt pests, eliminating opposing enemies, and loot those Chests.

Good luck out there, soldier!",

Lyrics:

Many nights
Many nights

Life feel like a war, but lord protecting my soul
praying on my knees so many nights
Murders right outside this worlds terrorized
You make it out, you'll treat this shit like paradise
Many nights
Money stack in the wallet its secure
Doc did an ultra scan on my heart and it's pure
I can sit back tell ya all that we can endure, grind many nights
Cash with different countries I take every kind
Built another brand, shit big as calvin klein
Better watch me close, ya’ll want a mastermind
I'm the one givin 'em hope and nigga that's a sign

many nights, many nights
Cool summer, thin as ice
Many nights, many cries, real ties
another hundred, count a million times
 
Know I told you once that only time will reveal
Any loan I ever got I been on time with my bill
All this cash come from my stock gon' make me interest a year
Betcha every single I count, I'm giving attention this year

Many nights
……… stayin focused while I'm blazing this spliff
Sixty racks out my account a couple days for a trip
Pretty bitch? on my line waiting any day for the trip
Belly nights
Narcos in my bag im gettin  'Very high'
Said you got my back then don't you never lie
Built a new foundation and it stabilized
I don't want your help I want you patronized

many nights, many nights
Cool summer, thin as ice
Many nights, many cries, real ties
another hundred, count a million times
Paradise

Watch This: \"CHARLIE'S ANGELS: REBOOT – Fan-Made Concept Trailer\"

New faces. Same fearless mission.

In this action-packed fan-made concept trailer, Charlie's Angels: Reboot imagines a bold new chapter in the legendary franchise. Scarlett Johansson, Charlize Theron, and Angelina Jolie unite as a powerhouse trio of elite operatives — recruited by a new generation of Charlie to take on global threats with brains, beauty, and blistering combat skills.

When a covert tech weapon falls into the wrong hands, the Angels must race against time across continents, unravel a deadly conspiracy, and prove that this sisterhood is more unstoppable than ever.

With explosive action, stylish espionage, and fierce female energy, this trailer pays homage to the legacy of Charlie’s Angels while imagining a high-stakes, modern reboot for a new era.

They don’t just follow orders. They rewrite the mission.

LISTEN TO FARRUKO - LOUIS BPM PERFORMING “OE OE”

LETRA: OE OE

Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Amo la calle aunque sea peligrosa
Quiero una rumba
De esas Sabrosas
Pero en el barrio 
Que la vibra es otra cosa
(Bajo mundo!)
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Hoy la calle está prendida
Y yo estoy que boto fuego
Pa mi que va haber averia
Porque yo no estoy pa juegos
Prendela
Que no le voy a bajar
Prestámela 
Que la voy a desbaratar
Hoy la pista se quema
Tenemos todos los sistemas
Tamo en rumba y no en problema
Y síganme los buenos
Que la vibra está buena
Si es blanca o de piel morena
Si es bori o de Venezuela
Con cualquiera yo me caso
Sigueme los pasos
Que la rumba esta buena
Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Amo la calle aunque sea peligrosa
Quiero una rumba
De esas Sabrosas
Pero en el barrio 
Que la vibra es otra cosa
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe
Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Amo la calle aunque sea peligrosa
Quiero una rumba
De esas Sabrosas
Pero en el barrio 
Que la vibra es otra cosa
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe

Listen to Hell At Night feat. Ella Langley: https://symphony.to/bigxthaplug/hell-at-night

Lyrics:
Heartbreak’s a funny thing
How it makes you think
What it makes you want

Why, when it ends, us getting revenge
Sounds better than moving on

And I’d love to live and let live
Let it go, forgive and forget
Holding a grudge ain’t what I want to do
But when it comes to you

I hope it's hell at night
Straight to the morning
I hope you close your eyes
And just can’t ignore it
’Cause it’s too damn loud
Tossing and turning
I hope it's hell at night
And my memory’s burning, burning

Aye
I hope you hear me every time you play a song
I hope you meet the right person but y’all never get along
I hope you know you ain’t right, and you so good at burning bridges
I hope you finally find some love and every day he hurt your feelings
I hope you, I hope you turn your heater on and it blows cold
I hope you leave your car running at the store and it get stolen
I hope you have a nightmare every single day of your life
I hope you have a bad morning, and one hell of a night

I hope it's hell at night
Straight to the morning
I hope you close your eyes
And just can’t ignore it
’Cause it’s too damn loud
Tossing and turning
I hope it's hell at night
And my memory’s burning, burning

Aye
I hope you see me every time you close your eyes
And every time you think about me, you hear thunder in the sky
I’m out the way, and by the way, I hope you lived and what you learned
I hope you go deep into the woods, and you make the wrong turn
I hope it burns you up

Like a cigarette
Like a last call shot
Straight to the head
I hope stare at the wall
Or an old home screen
Kind of hopin’ I call
’Cause you can’t call me

I hope it's hell at night
Straight to the morning
I hope you close your eyes
And just can’t ignore it
’Cause it’s too damn loud
Tossing and turning
I hope it's hell at night
And my memory’s burning, burning

bloody rain floods these streets / came falling to the earth
run away a thunder hangs above me like an eye 
holy ghost | i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire
blows a wind it fills and quakes the houses from above
wide awake burning out the foxes from the vines
holy ghost | i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire
a display tongues of fire against the night
the display ignites your mind
feel the waves crash against the concrete from below 
a new wine intoxicates you slowly out of time
holy ghost | i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire
a display tongues of fire against the night
the display ignites your mind
holy ghost | i’m on fire
holy spirit | i’m on fire… i’m on fire
holy ghost (save save save me) i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire… i’m on fire

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
