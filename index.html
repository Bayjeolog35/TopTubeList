As he rampages through the city, swallowing Sprunkis and converting them into grotesque pawns, his wrath draws the attention of Gray, a former bystander desperate to stop the destruction. While a corrupt factory owner tries to cover up the source of the contamination, Gray seeks the wisdom of a dying Mr. Tree to understand the deeper cost of their actions. As the city falls under attack, a final decision must be made: destroy the factory and risk everything, or let the monster consume them all. In the end, nature reclaims what was taken, but the price is steep.\n\nDon't forget to like, comment, subscribe and share to show your support for this channel!\n\nFollow us here for all sorts of cool stuff!\n‚ñ∫ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/gametoonsofficial/?hl=en üì∏\n‚ñ∫ TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@gametoonsofficial?lang=en üéµ\n\nSuggested rating: TV-PG\nThis video contains material not suitable for younger audiences.",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY¬Æ Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani‚Äôs 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY¬Æ Award nod in the category of ‚ÄúBest Urban Contemporary Album.‚Äù On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 50 Best Albums of 2017‚Äù and Rolling Stone‚Äôs ‚Äú20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.‚Äù \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B‚Äôs double-platinum ‚ÄúRing,‚Äù Kyle‚Äôs platinum ‚ÄúPLAYINWITME,‚Äù and Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Me,‚Äù to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles‚Äî\"You Should Be Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDistraction,‚Äù for which she received her second GRAMMY¬Æ nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles‚Äî‚ÄúGangsta,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù [feat. Chance the Rapper], ‚ÄúCRZY,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNights Like This‚Äù [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the ‚ÄúRule Breaker Award‚Äù as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019‚Äôs chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù and ‚ÄúEverybody Business.‚Äù In the end, you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs on Kehlani‚Äôs mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialMusicVideo",

It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet¬≠-to-¬≠be¬≠-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #RobloxForsaken #Forsaken #RobloxHorror #Horror #xDemon #Goobers",

  <strong>Who are we?</strong><br>
  We‚Äôre a data-driven team on a mission to track and showcase the <strong>most viewed YouTube videos</strong> around the world ‚Äî updated every 4 to 6 hours.
  Whether MrBeast has dropped another crazy challenge, BLACKPINK released a new MV, or T-Series hit another billion, we‚Äôre already listing it.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>What‚Äôs our goal?</strong><br>
  To provide real-time, reliable, and refreshingly simple access to YouTube‚Äôs trending landscape. Currently, we‚Äôre global ‚Äî but our dream is to go local.
  Imagine being able to filter videos by country and ask, <em>‚ÄúWhat was the most viewed video in the U.S. in the last 24 hours?‚Äù</em> Yeah, we want that too.
</p>

<p>
  We‚Äôre not begging for funds, but let‚Äôs just say... <strong>support helps</strong>. The more we grow, the faster we‚Äôll deliver features like country-based filters,
  historical trend tracking, and more.
</p>

<p>
  Until then, enjoy the latest from <strong>Taylor Swift, PewDiePie, Bad Bunny, Alan Walker, Zach King, KSI, Selena Gomez</strong>, and many more ‚Äî served fresh, with stats.
