LYRICS
I saw your green hair
Beauty mark next to your mouth
There on the subway
I nearly had a breakdown
 
A few weeks later
Somebody wore your perfume
It almost killed me
I had to leave the room
 
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
It's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
It's never over
 
Til I don't look for you on the staircase
Or wish you thought that we were still soulmates
But I'm still counting down all of the days
Til you're just another girl on the subway
 
Made you the villain
Evil for just moving on
I see your shadow
I see it even with the lights off
I made a promise, if in four months this feeling ain't gone
Well, fuck this city! I'm movin' to Saskatchewan
 
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
Oh til its over
It's just another day
And it's not over till it's over
It's never over
 
Til I can break routine during foreplay
And trust myself that I won’t say your name
But I'm still counting down all of the days
Til you're just another girl on the subway
 
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
 
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
 
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
 
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
 
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
 
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
 
She’s got, she’s got a way
 
She’s got a way, she’s got a way
 
She got, she got away
 
She got away, she got away

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

The inspiration behind this video:
The web of destiny spins again in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, the highly anticipated return of Tom Holland’s Peter Parker. After the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Peter is left with no allies, no identity, and a dangerous new city to protect. But a new Spider-Man movie means new threats, new alliances, and a new home. This Spider-Man Brand New Day trailer introduces powerful new characters, including Sadie Sink, and teases the emotional evolution of Spider-Man as he embraces a darker path to redemption. Get ready for an action-packed Spider-Man 2026 trailer experience filled with stunning VFX, multiversal twists, and grounded storytelling in true Marvel fashion. Join the hype with visuals inspired by FilmSpot Trailer, TeaserPRO, MovieGasm, KinoCheck, and EmergencyAwesome.

From Marvel Studios and the creators of the MCU, this concept trailer blends the energy of Spider-Man: No Way Home with the bold possibilities of Spider-Man 4: Brand New Day. Whether you're here for the Spider-Man new home trailer, the Spider-Man Brand New Day teaser trailer, or just the excitement of a new Spider-Man movie, you're in the right place.

Letra de Banda de Camión

Tú no te busca' cuarto' ni con la ubicación por GPS
A donde llego, hasta lo' generale' 'tán de pie
Tú priva' en vacanón y to' lo' día' andando a pie'
Yo sueno en Nueva York, en Guachupita y Lavapiés
La calle 'tá prendía' cada ve' que el loco tira
Y la mujere' mueven la' nalga' como Shakira
A lo' pariguayo' lo' mandamo' a hace' la fila
¿Tú me viene' a monta' pila y ni siquiera te depila'?
Tú no 'tá sonando, hay que ponerte par de pila'
Y en la discoteca suena El Alfa por pila
A donde llego la' mujere' a mí me miran pila
Toma ese palito y la mierda de chivo apila
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-tam, que llegó el sicario
En la calle, culo' disponible' tengo vario'
Tu mujer me busca pa' que le rompa lo' ovario'
En el juego, tú ere' Luigi, pero yo soy Mario
Chofer, que me deje en la esquina, que me pasé
Cero coro con palomo', como debe se'
Ustede' tienen que besarme la mano y lo' pie'
La' mujere' beben de la blanca y se quitan la sed
Tengo verbo, cotorra, tigueraje y cutupla
Tú no 'tá sonando en la calle, pa' que te supla'
No te compare', que tú no ere' mi size
Doy lo' cuarto' en la calle como que e' un wifi

[Skit]
Ofrecome, pero a ese loco hay que darle banda
¿Pero de qué hay que darle banda?
¿De bicicleta? No
¿De carro? No
¿De avioneta? No
¿De barco de lo' que llegan al muelle? No
¿Pero de qué?

[Coro]
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión
A mí hay que darme banda de camión

[Post-Coro]
Dame, dame banda
Dame, dame banda
Dame, dame banda
Dame, dame banda

[Verso 2]
Yo pego nuevo' talento' en lo que dicen \"Berenjena\"
Pero con cotorra' de la' mía', nunca ajena'
Cadena falsifica', la medalla y el guillo
Yo tengo má' valor que lo' que mata'n a Trujillo
Él dice que él e' duro, ahí e' que yo me quillo
Como dicen lo' españole': \"Si me lo dejan, lo pillo\"
Tú me va' a llega' cuando deje de sali' el sol
O cuando jueguen tenis con pelota 'e basketball
Yo cruzo lo' peaje', manito, sin paga' toll
Si te pasa' conmigo, te llevo a visita' al doctor
Pero no El Dotol que trabaja en Alofoke
Si el dembow fuera un punto, yo soy el dueño del bloque",

    "description": "#harrisonford #angelinajoliepitt #indianajones 
Watch this fan-made concept trailer for Indiana Jones 6 (2026) – a thrilling continuation of the legendary adventure saga.

Years after his last quest, Indiana Jones finds himself pulled back into the shadows of ancient mysteries and modern conspiracies. Harrison Ford returns as the iconic archaeologist, older but not outmatched, as he faces one final mission that could alter the course of history.

When a powerful relic surfaces—tied to a forgotten civilization and a secret global war—Dr. Jones must join forces with a brilliant and fearless historian, played by Angelina Jolie. Together, they race against dark forces, uncovering buried secrets and battling enemies who will stop at nothing to possess the artifact.

Set against a backdrop of exotic locations, epic chases, and ancient puzzles, this reimagined chapter explores legacy, sacrifice, and the cost of knowing too much.

Happy National Spider-Man Day! From Golden Century Films and our \"Marvel Inspire\" universe, this is the official teaser trailer for 'Spider-Man: Alone.'

Season 1 of 'Spider-Man: Alone' is a deeply personal, character-driven fan series that plunges into the heart of Peter Parker's earliest days. A modern, street-level reimagining of Amazing Fantasy #15, our story explores the profound isolation and immense weight of newfound powers. This is the story of a boy learning to fly, and the agonizing, often lonely, process of what it cost him to become a hero.

This project is also proud to launch our Inspired Action initiative in partnership with the non-profit Friendly Neighborhood Activist, aiming to turn on-screen heroism into real-world change.

LETRA
(Combo mango)
(Planet Planet pla pla pla)
(Ferrante)
(Eleggua)

No le hables de money
Que ella es la lotería
Ni de descaro
Que ella es la putería

Te esta dando cacho (ay)
Cosa gorda (titi)
Y de nada, se desborda
Ay diablo Titi te noto sobresalía

Que rico sería
Echar un palo en tu carpintería
Y que ese culo sea de mi autoria
Hacertelo rico con garantía

Que rico sería
Que tu me des
Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne, carne
En tu carnicería
Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne

Carne
Pa que yo me encarne
Mami no te alarmes cuando se me cruce el cable
Tu sabes que yo soy crónico
Y no aguanto más
Tu provocándome, para de hacerlo ya

No vaya a ser que yo te coma
Y te deje en coma
Cuando te meta, toma, toma
To to toma

Que rico sería
Echar un palo en tu carpintería
Y que ese culo sea de mi autoria
Hacertelo rico con garantía

Que rico sería
Que tu me des
Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne, carne
En tu carnicería
Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne

No quiero una del bulto
Quiero una de Houston
O de Tampa
Porque las de Hialeah ya son mía
Como mismo lo fue la de Colón con la de Jesus María

Le hiciste un amarre a la pieza
Déjate de aguaje que te noto tieza
Sal de arriba de mi que tu pesas
Ve para allá con la cara esa, esa

Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne, carne
En tu carnicería
Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne

Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne, carne
En tu carnicería
Carne, carne, carne, carne, carne

Omarito con el Cucu
Dary pegado en Miami
El chulito que le dijo Arango
(Habla Ferrante)
Amarren a todas sus piezas
Las va a coger la marca mango

Tra tra tra tra tra tra
Richard Transimport
Yhona, el Eruke, Papote, Papote
Ferrante
Que dice Ronald el abusata
Que esto va a está pegao donde hay

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
