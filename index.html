LYRICS
I fell in love with a crazy bitch
She fucks me good 
She's a lunatic
Sut that's how I like my women

She keyed my truck
She stole my dog
She broke my heart 
Then I lost my job 
But that's only the beginning 

She's my future ex wife 
And we're moving real fast 
She's got me by the balls
She's a pain in my ass

But that's how I like my women 
Head spinnin' 
Round and round like an exorcism
It really turns me on 
That's how I like my ladies
Real crazy 
Bring it on cuz that shit don't phase me 
She might be 
Just a little crazier than me

I fell in love with a narcissist 
Her dad walked out and her mom's a bitch
She's psycho but that's a given 
(What's up Hardy!)
She's got a bible verse tatt'ed on her ass 
Never been to church 
Not to mention that                                                                                      
One more DUI sends her to prison 
(I love you)

But that's how I like my women 
Head spinnin' 
Round and round like an exorcism
It really turns me on 
That's how I like my ladies
Real crazy 
Bring it on cuz that shit don't phase me 
She might be
Just a little crazier than me

She's a little bit bipolar
She tells me that it's over
Then asks me to come over, again

She's my future ex wife 
and we're moving too fast 
She's got me by my balls
She's a pain in my ass

But that's how I like my women 
Head spinnin' 
Round and round like an exorcism
It really turns me on  
That's how I like my ladies
Real crazy 
Bring it on cuz that shit don't phase me 
She might be
Just a little crazier than you
She might be 
Just a little crazier than me

    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?

From Oscar® winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).

Former college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.

Just when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.

The film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.

HIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw’s Kate Oh.

Lyrics:

Run that back, Turbo

Overseas in Europe, I hit Zurich, bought a watch
Kicking it my purest, my influence worth a lot
Bought my bitch the urus that I skirt to that drop
Better see my jewelry, that shit blurry, at the top
Top, top, top, top
I'm kicking it at the top
T-O-P, I'm up
Eyes on me like Pac
Push one up whenever I walk
Can't touch me I'm too hot
Hunnids inside of a vault
Mans is covered in croc
Croc
Alligator or Croc
Human ain't no telling
Young GunnaWun for president, let my ho go presi'
Countin' up stackin' these presidents, know this shit get treacherous

Wake up takin' these chances
Business man I barely drive I bought me two new Caddys
Got acres I can sell you land, costs at least two Patek's
LS state behind the gate, don't let 'em know my addy
Pretty face from 'round the way, come play I do her nasty
Plain jane I ain't flashy
Gucci shorts they khaki
Fucking a slut accountant bitch she help me lower my taxes
Young Gunna wunna a chest set up in …. On top my jacket
Caviar the riviar of France, they stuffin my passes

Overseas in Europe, I hit Zurich, bought a watch
Kicking it my purest, my influence worth a lot
Bought my bitch the urus that I skirt to that drop
Better see my jewelry, my shit blurry, at the top
Top, top
I'm kicking it at the top
T-O-P, I'm up
Eyes on me like Pac
Push one up I walk
Can't touch me I'm too hot
Hunnids inside of a vault, man is covered in Croc

Rockstar grab my crotch
Rick Owen high tops
I go in Miami, Kawasaki with two thots
She fuck with the top
Cashed out ice me out
Burnt that nigga's chop
I did this shit for granny, look down my wrist is a Grammy
Princess like diani, introduce her to my family
Flower she my dandy, but don't come for not at all
I ain't going at all, I took out the brain and tore down on 'em all
Plain Jane I let it went froze, this shit is insane they thought I would fall
The flames come out the exhaust, the Ferrari spider, it climb up the wall
She learnin' to deal with a dog
The double R star see Mars
I told her to beat it, get off me
I only be fucking with stars
I got in my groove like Austin

Overseas in Europe, I hit Zurich, bought a watch
Kicking it my purest, my influence worth a lot
Bought my bitch the urus that I skirt to that drop
Better see my jewelry, my shit blurry, at the top
Top, top
I'm kicking it at the top
T-O-P, I'm up
Eyes on me like Pac
Push up whenever I walk
Can't touch me I'm too hot
Hunnids inside of a vault, Mans is covered in Croc

The bugs out there? Vicious, relentless, swarming. The Island is an absolute mess of goopy nests and egg sacs. Prepare to stomp and smash the swarm with the O.X.R., the Island’s anti-bug military defense force.

If you’re serious about stomping roachies, then you’ll want to pick up new weapons issues by O.X.R. ike the Leadspitter 3000 minigun, Sweeper Shotgun, O.X.R. Rifle, Wrecker Revolver, or the laser-guided Swarmstrike rocket launcher.

And don’t forget about leveling up with the Shock ‘N Awesome Battle Pass to knock the socks off the swarm with style! New Outfits include:

UNSC Spartan
Yoo-mi
Agent Patch
Battle Gamer Mae
Lt. Ripp Slade
Onyx Winter
Green Ranger

Time to pelt pests, eliminating opposing enemies, and loot those Chests.

Good luck out there, soldier!",

    "description": "Watch this Twilight 6 - Fan-Made Concept Trailer

The saga continues…

In this fan-made concept trailer, the world of Twilight returns with a haunting new chapter. Robert Pattinson is back as Edward Cullen — older, darker, and more conflicted than ever. As ancient forces awaken and new enemies rise, the Cullen family must once again face a threat that could destroy their legacy forever.

Kristen Stewart’s Bella stands torn between the shadows of her past and the future of her daughter, Renesmee, whose mysterious powers have drawn the attention of powerful, unseen enemies.

Love. Immortality. War.

Will Edward and Bella’s bond survive the darkness that’s coming?

Lyrics

You think
I was born to ruin your life
But you did
Most of that before I arrived
Some things are broken when you open the box
So stop this, you’ve gone too far, enough is enough

I wish I didn’t care this much but I do
No one knows the half of it what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best 


Cause I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

Blame it on your history and say it’s not your fault
I can’t call you crazy cause you could be diagnosed
Oh I used to love you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

I wish you would look in the mirror cause if you did
You’d see the problem is you, cause you’re a prick
I know that I’m your scapegoat whenever the rain falls
Whenever you slip or when you’re in a dip
I was there to lean on when I was kid
But now that I’m an adult I see it for what it is
I have to lock the door now fuck building a bridge
Take all your apologies and put them in the bin

And for your Dad’s sake, please move out your Dad’s place
Stop bringing drama there with your mates 
Your sister’s got enough to manage on her plate
To worry ‘bout you controlling your rage
And one day we’ll all be dead
But between now and then
I never want to see you again

I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more
Life got better when I lost you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

Blame it on your history and say it’s not your fault
I can’t call you crazy cause you could be diagnosed
Oh I used to love you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more


I wish I didn’t care this much but I do
No one knows the half of it what you put me through
And I, I sometimes wonder do you live with regret
Wish I could say I wish you the best 
But I don’t 

I used to love you
Now every day I hate you just a little more 
Life got better when I lost you
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more

Blame it on your history and say it’s not your fault
I can’t call you crazy cause you could be diagnosed
Oh I used to love you 
But every day I hate you just a little more and more and more",

Lyrics: 
Can't help but notice, all of the ways 
In which I failed myself, I failed the world all the same 
I don't think I'm pretty, it's not up for debate 
A woman's best currency is her body, not her brain 

They try to tell me, tell me I'm wrong
But mirrors tell lies to me, my mind just plays along
The world is a sick place, at least for a girl
The people want beauty, skinny always wins
And I don't have enough of it, I'll never have enough of it 

Sometimes I see her, she looks like Snow White
She's everything I am but my wrongs are turned to rights 
Her body is smaller, skin is so fair
She's achieved everything I've dreamed of 
And it's all that I can think of 

They try to tell me, tell me I'm wrong 
But mirrors tell lies to me, my mind just plays along
The world is a sick place, at least for a girl
The people want beauty, skinny, always wins 
And I don't have enough of it, I'll never have enough of it",

bloody rain floods these streets / came falling to the earth
run away a thunder hangs above me like an eye 
holy ghost | i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire
blows a wind it fills and quakes the houses from above
wide awake burning out the foxes from the vines
holy ghost | i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire
a display tongues of fire against the night
the display ignites your mind
feel the waves crash against the concrete from below 
a new wine intoxicates you slowly out of time
holy ghost | i’m on fire 
holy spirit | i’m on fire
a display tongues of fire against the night
the display ignites your mind
holy ghost | i’m on fire
holy spirit | i’m on fire… i’m on fire

In 2023, Zimmerman released his debut album Religiously. The Album. which arrived as not only the biggest streaming debut for a country album in history, but also the biggest all-genre streaming debut since 2021.

In 2024, Zimmerman continued to dominate the charts with singles \"Holy Smokes,” “Holding On” and “New To Country” all of which made a splash. August of 2025 saw the release of Zimmerman’s Sophomore album Different Night Same Rodeo which features superstar collaboration “Backup Plan” featuring Luke Combs as well as Top 10 and platinum single “Holy Smokes,” in addition to “New To Country,” “Hell or High Water,” “Holding On,” “Comin’ In Cold,” and more.

LISTEN TO FARRUKO - LOUIS BPM PERFORMING “OE OE”

LETRA: OE OE

Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Amo la calle aunque sea peligrosa
Quiero una rumba
De esas Sabrosas
Pero en el barrio 
Que la vibra es otra cosa
(Bajo mundo!)
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Hoy la calle está prendida
Y yo estoy que boto fuego
Pa mi que va haber averia
Porque yo no estoy pa juegos
Prendela
Que no le voy a bajar
Prestámela 
Que la voy a desbaratar
Hoy la pista se quema
Tenemos todos los sistemas
Tamo en rumba y no en problema
Y síganme los buenos
Que la vibra está buena
Si es blanca o de piel morena
Si es bori o de Venezuela
Con cualquiera yo me caso
Sigueme los pasos
Que la rumba esta buena
Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Amo la calle aunque sea peligrosa
Quiero una rumba
De esas Sabrosas
Pero en el barrio 
Que la vibra es otra cosa
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe
Aquí se sufre
Pero se goza
Amo la calle aunque sea peligrosa
Quiero una rumba
De esas Sabrosas
Pero en el barrio 
Que la vibra es otra cosa
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe 
Oe oe oe

📝 Letra/ Lyrics:

Baby, me vuelves loco
No se esperó al hotel y arriba del Merced
Mirándome a los ojos
\"Hazme tuya otra vez, por última vez\"
Sabe que estoy loco
Pedí el tusi por el cel, no la llevé a Chanel
Quería probarme un poco
Ya le quité el antojo
Tragos de Henny, loco
Ya van a dar las 6:00 y arriba de tu piel
Quiero pegarme un polvo
Y chingarte bien coco
Baby, ¿qué más?
¿Qué fue?
¿Qué tal si por la noche apagamos los dos el cel?
Bebé
Bien chula y aparte de todo tú eres niña bien
¿Qué onda?
Y así suena el amor de la Calle, baby
Ey, ey, ey
Que sigan llegando las pacas, carnal
La verdadera presión
La C del 2 y el 4, viejo
Fuerza Regida, viejo
Como siempre, pariente
Chula, préndeme el porro
Maquíllate otra vez, no vayan a saber
Lo que te hace este cholo
Contéstale a ese güey, dile que todo bien
Mami, borra las fotos
Que tomamos ayer sin ropa en el motel
Con las luces en rojo
Barbie modelo porno
Qué ojos, qué piel, qué rollo
El diablo hecho mujer, por ti me porto bien
Todita te conozco
Hasta mejor que el tonto
Baby, ¿qué más?
¿Qué fue?
¿Qué tal si por la noche apagamos los dos el cel?
Bebé
Bien chula y aparte de todo tú eres niña bien
¿Qué onda?
¿Qué tal si por la noche apagamos los dos el cel?
Bebé
¿Qué onda?

Lyrics:

لانعي حالي 
عاللي جرالي 
تعصف فيي رياح الويل 
مخاوي نجوم الليل

تاهوا دروبي 
شمسي غروبي 
يصطف الحزن بالدور 
يطلع هالنفس بالزور
 
علاش تروح تخليني
بدال الدم الي فيني
يجري سم وينهيني
 شوي شوي 

علاش تروح وبلايا 
تنسى طريقي وهوايا
كيف تتبدل النوايا 
الدم يصير مي 

ياما سندتهن يا أنا وهي أنا وحدي بقيت
أخدوك لحم .. وعضم؛ للذيابة رميوك
ياما ضويتلهن درب وبالعتم وحدي عميت
لولا نفيساً جوهرك ياجنيد ماباعوك.

ياما ياصاحب حذرت مالن أمان 
ياجود بجافوك بليالي وضحاهم ياما راهنت عليهن وخسرت الرهان لكن اصالة  معدنك بيسان تسواهم

علاش تروح تخلينيبدال الدم الي فيني يجري سم وينهيني
 شوي شوي علاش تروح وبلايا تنسى طريقي وهواياكيف تتبدل النوايا الدم يصير مي 


رغم اني ابن اليوم 
زعلان عاللي راح 
محرومة عيني النوم
كلي جراح

كونو العين بالعين
وحياة ضو العين
رد الصاع صاعين
حتى ارتاح

علاش تروح تخلينيبدال الدم الي فيني يجري سم وينهيني
 شوي شوي علاش تروح وبلايا تنسى طريقي وهواياكيف تتبدل النوايا الدم يصير مي

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
