Chaves directs from a screenplay by Ian Goldberg & Richard Naing and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, story by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick & James Wan, based on characters created by Chad Hayes & Carey W. Hayes.  The executive producers are Michael Clear, Judson Scott, Hans Ritter, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Natalia Safran, John Rickard and Michael Chaves.

Chaves is joined behind the camera by his creative team, including director of photography Eli Born, production designer John Frankish, editors Elliot Greenberg and Gregory Plotkin, visual effects supervisor Scott Edelstein, visual effects producer Eric Bruneau and costume designer Graham Churchyard, with casting by Rose Wicksteed and Sophie Kingston-Smith.  The music supervisor is Ian Broucek and the music is by composer Benjamin Wallfisch.

Me dice me escapo…
Me dice me… (Ra Rauw)

Lo nuestro empezó algo esporádico,
Fuiste cogiendo confi
Hasta que lo pedías sin plástico
Uff…
Me saca lo problemático
Hey…
Baby me va’ a juquear rápido

Si quieres verme, no pongas peros
El problema no es sentir
Es quién lo dice primero
Tú eres bipolar, yo soy medio grosero
Vamo’ a destrozar la casa, acabar en el suelo
Hasta llegar a buenos

Términos, términos
Se vino el splash y aquí encima terminó
Terminó, terminó
En cuatro le prendí el flash y más se inclinó
Buenos términos, buenos términos

Te viniste…
Dime cuándo no
Dime cuándo no, cuándo no
Peleamo’ y nos comemo’ y queda en buenos términos

(Mami, quítate los taco y dóblate ahí)
Dale Don dale, dale Don Julio
Pa’ que la nena resbale
Solo tiene puesto el tanning debajo del traje
Ella es dulce como el matcha con agave
Pero a veces lo de bicha se le sale

Cuando le explota la nota y te pide más
Se fue pa’ no volver pero ella es un boomerang
Una gatúbela está marca’ por la maldad
Te la encuentras por la “Cerra”, ahí como si nada hubiera pasao’
Y eso me gusta a mí
Pero soy el hijo’e puta mami que te gusta ti yeah,
Ya yo le he dao’, encharca’ yo la vi
es Rauw Alejandro

Si quieres verme no pongas pero
El problema no es sentir
Es quién lo dice primero
Tú eres bipolar, yo soy medio grosero
Vamo’ a destrozar la casa, acabar en el suelo

The Subway Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I saw your green hair
Beauty mark next to your mouth
There on the subway
I nearly had a breakdown
A few weeks later
Somebody wore your perfume
It almost killed me
I had to leave the room

[Chorus]
It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
Oh, it's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
It's never over

[Post-Chorus]
'Til I don't look for you on the staircase
Or wish you still thought we were soulmates
I'm still counting down all of the days
'Til you're just another girl on the subway

[Verse 2]
Made you the villain
Evil for just moving on
I see your shadow
I see it even with the lights off
I made a promise, if in four months this feeling ain't gone
Well, fuck this city, I'm movin' to Saskatchewan
[Chorus]
It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
It's never over
It's just another day
And it's not over 'til it's over
It's never over

[Post-Chorus]
'Til I can break routine during foreplay
And trust myself that I won't say your name
Yeah, I'm still counting down all of the days
'Til you're just another girl on the subway

[Outro]
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away
She's got, she's got a way
She's got a way, she's got a way
She got, she got away
She got away, she got away

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

Lyrics: 
This skyscraper’s causing vertigo
The countdown begins in Tokyo
Twenty seven days alone
Means 20 million ways to cope without you

I’m in a reckless fever
Love-struck girl, I’d tease her
Thought I’d never be her
Quite the job you’ve done on me, sir
You’ve been hosting parties
In my mind, I’m working overtime
To have you in my world
Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl 

Forced to get creative, wrote my feelings down
The independent lady in me’s nowhere to be found
I can’t wait another day to see you how embarrassing
To be this way

I’m in a reckless fever
Love-struck girl, I’d tease her
Thought I’d never be her
Quite the job you’ve done on me, sir
You’ve been hosting parties
In my mind, I’m working overtime
To have you in my world
Oh, what a curse it is to be in love

I wait by the phone like a high school movie
Dream at the shows you’ll come running to me
Think I see you in the wings, god
I'm hallucinating what a

Reckless fever
Love-struck girl, I’d tease her
Thought I’d never be her
Quite the job you’ve done on me, sir
You’ve been hosting parties
In my mind, I’m working overtime
You’ve become my whole world
Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl

What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

While new gladiators, main cast and a hopeful desire to appeal to a modern audience. Spartacus: House of Ashur is trying to make a Spartacus series, without Spartacus.

•LETRA
La cabeza yo nunca la agacho
Ni para abrocharme los zapatos
Tamos bendecidos como quiera
Dios me libre de gente culera

Las calles me dieron mi diploma
Y ahora navego mi mamalona
A mi lado siempre una nalgona
Carita de barbie pero cabrona

La cabeza yo nunca la agacho
Ni para ajustarme los zapatos
Tamos bendecidos como quiera
Dios me libre de gente culera

Y Ahora traigo pasta
Prendo uno de mostaza
Pa fumar con la raza
Las plebitas tiran wasap
Que les caiga pal cantón
Por qué quieren ver acción
Aguardiente y lavadón
Tequila, caguama, champaña
Y tusita bubalo

Buena ta la loquera
Bueno ta el ondeadón
Pinche gente Culera
Que habla y sin razón
Inhalo y exalo
Y saco lo malo

Y a los que me critican
Ja, ja neta dan risa
Wacha esa nalguita
Que rica mamacita

Me pinteaba la escuela de morro
Y con los plebes me echaba un Porro
El estudio nunca fue mi rollo
Pero yo supe salir del hoyo

Pal trabajo yo nunca me rajo
Pero también me gusta el relajo
San juditas siempre me ilumina
Ya es viernes vamos por unas Frias

Y Ahora traigo pasta
Prendo uno de mostaza
Pa fumar con la raza
Las plebitas tiran wasap
Que les caiga pal cantón
Por qué quieren ver acción
Aguardiente y lavadón
Tequila, caguama, champaña
Y tusita bubalo

Buena ta la loquera
Bueno ta el ondeadón
Pinche gente Culera

Inhalo y exalo
Y saco lo malo

    "description": "🧛 Half human, half vampire, you know his name — Blade. 
 
Almost a century ago, Eric Brooks was born of two worlds: the light of his mother's embrace and the dark of the vampire that attacked her. After embracing his existence as a dhampir, he became the Daywalker, the ultimate vampire hunter, combining unmatched combat skills and unwavering supernatural abilities. 
 
When Dracula reigned over New York City, it was none other than Blade who confronted him first. By then, however, it was too late. Dracula had mastered the almighty power of Chronovium, defeating the Daywalker and imprisoning him within the castle dungeon. 
 
After Dracula's fall, Blade was sent to Wakanda to recover, but his story is far from over. Now recruited by Shuri to save all existence, Blade stands awake and at the ready against the dark forces of Hela and Knull.

🎤 Lyrics: Huntrix - Takedown KPop Demon Hunters

Takedown, takedown
Takedown, down, down, down (HUNTR/X girls to the world)
Takedown, takedown
Takedown, down, down, down (it's a takedown)

So sweet, so easy on the eyes, but hideous on the inside
Whole life spreadin' lies, but you can't hide, baby, nice try
I'm 'bout to switch up these vibes, I finally opened my eyes
It's time to kick you straight back into the night

'Cause I see your real face and it's ugly as sin
Time to put you in your place 'cause you're rotten within
When your patterns start to show
It makes the hatred wanna grow outta my veins

I don't think you're ready for the takedown
Break you into pieces in the world of pain 'cause you're all the same
Yeah, it's a takedown
A demon with no feelings don't deserve to live, it's so obvious

I'ma gear up and take you down
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (it's a takedown)
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (I'ma take it down)
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (it's a takedown)
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (take it down)

It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, you break down like, \"What?\"
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out, and it ain't gonna stop
정신을 놓고 널 짓밟고 칼을 새겨놔
(Jeongsineul noko neol jitbalgo kareul saegyeonwa)
You'll be beggin' and cryin', all of you dyin', never miss my shot

When your patterns start to show
It makes the hatred wanna grow outta my veins

I don't think you're ready for the takedown
당당하게 어둠 앞에 다가서 다 무너뜨려
(Dangdanghage eodum ape dagaseo da muneotteuryeo)
Yeah, it's a takedown, a demon with no feelings
Don't deserve to live, it's so obvious

I'ma gear up and take you down
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (it's a takedown)
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (I'ma take it down, watch me do it, yeah)
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (it's a takedown, ooh)
Whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (ooh)

Oh, you're the master of illusion
나를 속이려 하지마
(Nareul sogiryeo hajima)
Look at all the masses that you're foolin'
But they'll turn on you soon, so how?

How can you sleep or live with yourself?
A broken soul trapped in a nastiest shell
영혼없는 니 목숨을 귾으러 and watch you die-ie-ie
(Yeonghoneomneun ni moksumeul geuneureo and watch you die-ie-ie)
You can try, but you can't hide

It's a takedown, I'ma take you out (oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh), you break down like, \"What?\"
It's a takedown, I'ma take you out (oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh), and I ain't gonna stop
I'ma cut you up, you'll lose control (oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh), then rip out your heart
You'll be beggin' and cryin', all of you dyin' (oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)

I'ma gear up and take you down
Oh, whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (la-la-la, it's a takedown, oh)
Oh, whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'ma take it down)
Oh, whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (ooh, it's a takedown, ooh)
Oh, whoa-oh, da-da-da, down (watch me do it, yeah)

Take it down

    "description": "🚶‍♂️ THE LONG WALK – Final Trailer (2025) | Stephen King Adaptation 🔥
Only one can survive the walk. From the twisted mind of Stephen King comes The Long Walk — a chilling dystopian thriller brought to life in this long-awaited cinematic adaptation. Witness the psychological and physical unraveling of 100 teenage boys forced to walk until only one remains — or die trying.

🎬 Film Overview:
In a near-future America ruled by a totalitarian regime, a brutal annual contest known as The Long Walk pits 100 teenage participants against one another in a harrowing test of endurance. The rules are simple: Keep walking above 4 mph. Stop three times — and you're eliminated… permanently. As the miles stretch on and friendships turn to rivalries, survival becomes a psychological warzone.

🕴  John Wick: Chapter 5

Speculation is swirling online that John Wick: Chapter 5 could be on the horizon, with fan communities buzzing about Keanu Reeves potentially donning the black suit one last time. Though there’s been no formal confirmation from Lionsgate or the actor himself, various breadcrumbs dropped in recent months have reignited hope for a continuation of the legendary assassin’s story.

Following the ambiguous ending of Chapter 4, where Wick is presumed dead — yet suspiciously off-screen — fans have theorized that the Baba Yaga may have faked his death to escape the High Table’s grasp. Some even believe this has been a long game, orchestrated with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), to dismantle the Table from the shadows.

Adding fuel to the fire, director Chad Stahelski recently mentioned in an interview that there are “more stories to be told in the Wick universe,” and fans were quick to point out that the word “chapter” implies an ongoing narrative rather than a definitive ending.

LYRICS / LETRA: 

Bella y sensual, mamacita se le nota que es real,  
sube un story porque hoy sale a pistear,  
Es un culazo, con carita angelical, la baby no tiene rival,  
Y antes que la noche se me acabe y empiece el nuevo día,  
solo quiero hacerte mía.  

Voy a robarte un beso, cuando estemos bien pedos,  
brindamos pa’ arriba pa’ bajo pal centro y pa’ dentro  
La nota por el cielo, la ropa por el suelo, 
brindamos pa’ arriba pa’ bajo pal centro y pa’ dentro. 

Soy fanático de lo que hay en tu interior,  
todo lo que tu traes es un misterio, 
cuando llegaste todo estuvo mejor, 
besitos sabor a tequila mi cielo. 

Y si estás conmigo te ves más guapa te ves más bella, 
si me preguntan por la que me gusta la señalo a ella, 
la veo bailando en la disco danza y se ve coqueta, 
y al salir de aquí, me quedo viendo su silueta. 

Y más yo quiero algo más  
desconocía si ya aquí metida cierra los ojos  

Voy a robarte un beso cuando estemos bien pedos,  
brindamos pa’ arriba pa’ bajo pal centro y pa’ dentro  

La nota por el cielo, la ropa por el suelo  
brindamos pa’ arriba pa’ bajo pal centro y pa’ dentro. 

Tu combinas con la luna y el mar flow natural  
te voy a robar, que tu combinas con la luna y el mar  
oh nanana, oh nanana na 
Que tu combinas con la luna y el mar flow natural  
te voy a robar que tu combinas con la luna y el mar  
oh nanana oh nanana 
Voy a robarte un beso cuando estemos bien pedos.

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
