    "description": "FNaF World is one of my favorite free games ever made, but unfortunately my bank account is in the negative so I can‚Äôt afford anything free anymore. I went to Vegas last month and bet my entire savings account (and then some!) on black, thinking my YouTuber luck would carry over. Spoiler alert, it didn‚Äôt. Thankfully, I can still play the FNaF World Demo even though I‚Äôm in debt, so here I am trying to figure out a way to make content out of it. I guess I haven‚Äôt made the obligatory 100%ing FNaF World video yet like everyone else, so now I‚Äôve decided to try and 100% the game with the added twist of doing it inside of the FNaF World Demo. This seems a lot simpler than it truly was however, as many literal barriers are found within the world halting your progress, and you can‚Äôt even use most of the characters! I would say if this video does well I can pay off my debts, but I actually think I already have in the process of making this! I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven‚Äôt really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you‚Äôre reading this I guess you‚Äôve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends! By the way if you even bothered to look at this description, write the comment ‚ÄúI am quite fond of DeeDee‚Äôs fishing hole‚Äù so I know you‚Äôre a real one, thanks!\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 - Prologue\n2:16 - Chapter 1 (I‚Äôm Gonna Play UCN!)\n4:05 - Chapter 2 (ok let‚Äôs start for real :))\n7:41 - Chapter 3 (The Barrier Problem!)\n11:17 - Chapter 4 (Subverting the Status Quo)\n15:26 - Chapter 5 (CBT)\n23:50 - Chapter 6 (TRIPLE TROPHY TROUBLE)\n29:56 - Chapter 7 (Yes, For Real!)\n\nCREDITS:\nTheDapperWaffle: Gameplay, script writing, editing, art, all that stuff.\nhttps://x.com/TheDapperWaffle\n\nAm_Person: Helped me get out of my emo phase towards the end of the video, and also helped me come up with the idea for this video in the first place!

I‚Äôm from the US but I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.
