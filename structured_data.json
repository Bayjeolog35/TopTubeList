    "description": "FNaF World is one of my favorite free games ever made, but unfortunately my bank account is in the negative so I can‚Äôt afford anything free anymore. I went to Vegas last month and bet my entire savings account (and then some!) on black, thinking my YouTuber luck would carry over. Spoiler alert, it didn‚Äôt. Thankfully, I can still play the FNaF World Demo even though I‚Äôm in debt, so here I am trying to figure out a way to make content out of it. I guess I haven‚Äôt made the obligatory 100%ing FNaF World video yet like everyone else, so now I‚Äôve decided to try and 100% the game with the added twist of doing it inside of the FNaF World Demo. This seems a lot simpler than it truly was however, as many literal barriers are found within the world halting your progress, and you can‚Äôt even use most of the characters! I would say if this video does well I can pay off my debts, but I actually think I already have in the process of making this! I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven‚Äôt really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you‚Äôre reading this I guess you‚Äôve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends!
