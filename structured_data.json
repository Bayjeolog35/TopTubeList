    "description": "Astronomers have just spotted something really strange moving through our solar system ‚Äî and it seems to be coming our way. This mysterious object is believed to have come from outside our solar system, making it possibly only the third known interstellar visitor ever discovered.\n\nIt‚Äôs currently being called 3I/ATLAS, and it was first seen in data collected between June 25 and June 29 by a system called ATLAS ‚Äî the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. This system uses powerful telescopes in Hawaii and South Africa to scan the night sky automatically for any unusual or potentially dangerous space objects.\nAfter the object was noticed, it was confirmed by experts at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies and the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center. That means it‚Äôs not just a glitch or mistake ‚Äî this thing is real.\n\nWhat makes 3I/ATLAS so fascinating is its strange speed and unknown nature. Scientists still aren‚Äôt sure what it actually is ‚Äî it could be a comet, an asteroid, or maybe even something we‚Äôve never seen before. One well-known astronomer, Avi Loeb from Harvard University ‚Äî who famously suggested that ‚ÄòOumuamua might have been an alien probe ‚Äî has weighed in again. This time, he‚Äôs suggesting that scientists use the powerful James Webb Space Telescope to study this newly discovered interstellar object in more detail.\n\n#interstellarobjects #oumuamua #2IBorisov #3IATLAS #interstellarvisitors #asteroid #comets #alien",

But new research reveals an even more terrifying possibility: widespread toxic spills, infrastructure collapse, wildfires, and deadly gas plumes. All triggered by a single seismic event.\n\nIn this episode of Weathered, we dig into the science behind the Cascadia Megaquake, why the Pacific Northwest is especially vulnerable, and how climate change could make it worse.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

I started by re-building the blower housing from the last project which had broken after getting wet. Then I set up the blower and tested a fixed pulley wheel that was held in place with a different configuration to the pulley wheels from the last project, where the pulley was outside of 2 stakes as opposed to between to stakes, in order to allow a crank handle to be attached directly to the wheel instead of to the rotor. But it had issues with durability so I decided to test the \"floating\" pulley wheel method I developed last time where the pulley has 2 handles and is held in the hands only with no support frame, spokes or hub of the fixed wheel design. The great reduction in parts makes it simpler and less likely to fail. It worked satisfactorily pushing about the same air as the \"one way spinning rope stick blower\" method and the \"2 way spinning blower method\" but with more even air flow. It gave a slightly above average yield of 21 g of cast iron prills from 1200g of ore as opposed to the normal 15 g from 1200g. This is despite the wood preheat phase of the furnace only being 25 minutes as opposed to 1 hour, preheating the furnace may be important to get the furnace to temperature before adding the charcoal and in future I'll do it for longer. Using the floating wheel isn't as tiring as I thought it might be and is comparable to the rope stick method and is much easier than the 2 way spinning method where a rope has to pulled outwards with two hands repeatedly. It is currently a good competitor to the rope stick method. However, if I want to scale up the wheel size and consequently rpm of the fan, I'll need to revisit the fixed wheel design as the floating wheel won't scale up. Overall, I see this method as a stepping stone to a better blower and better smelts in future.\n\n00:00-05:18 New blower housing\n05:18-06:51 Set up blower and furnace\n06:51-08:50 Banana fibre belt & splicing\n08:50-10:14 Little clay pulleys\n10:14-11:33 Testing a fixed pulley design\n11:33- 12:29 Making and testing floating pulley design\n12:29-14:09 Replace clay pulleys with fibre wrapped rotor/test\n14:09- 14:37 Smelt preparations\n14:37- 17:39 Smelt\n17:39- 19:09 Process bloom\n19:09- 19:48 Result\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
