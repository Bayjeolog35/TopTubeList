Watch the Official Trailer for The #RunningManMovie – Only in theatres November 7\n\n​In a near-future society, The Running Man is the top-rated show on television—a deadly competition where contestants, known as Runners, must survive 30 days while being hunted by professional assassins, with every move broadcast to a bloodthirsty public and each day bringing a greater cash reward. Desperate to save his sick daughter, working-class Ben Richards (Glen Powell) is convinced by the show’s charming but ruthless producer, Dan Killian (Josh Brolin), to enter the game as a last resort. But Ben’s defiance, instincts, and grit turn him into an unexpected fan favorite—and a threat to the entire system. As ratings skyrocket, so does the danger, and Ben must outwit not just the Hunters, but a nation addicted to watching him fall.\n\nConnect with #RunningManMovie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/RunningManMovie\nX: https://x.com/RunningManMovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RunningManMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@RunningManMovie\nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@RunningManMovie\n\nParamount Pictures Corporation (PPC), a major global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment, is a unit of Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB, VIA), home to premier global media brands that create compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, apps, games, consumer products, social media experiences, and other entertainment content for audiences in more than 180 countries.\n \nConnect with Paramount Pictures Online:\nOfficial Site: http://www.paramount.com/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@paramountpics\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/ParamountPics\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/paramountpics\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/Paramount\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Paramount",

In the wonderfully whimsical tradition of Dr. Seuss, The Cat in the Hat comes to the big screen in his animated theatrical feature film debut, an all-new, epic adventure with an edge, where mischief, magic and mayhem reign supreme.\n\nDoing what he does best, the Cat—voiced by Bill Hader—spreads joy to kids in his hilarious, signature and singularly irreverent way, transporting them and audiences on a fantastical journey through a world they’ve never seen before.\n\nIn the film, our hero takes on his toughest assignment yet for the I.I.I.I. (Institute for the Institution of Imagination and Inspiration, LLC): to cheer Gabby and Sebastian, a pair of siblings struggling with their move to a new town. Known for taking things too far, this could be this agent of chaos’s last chance to prove himself...or lose his magical hat!\n\nStarring alongside Hader are Xochitl Gomez, Matt Berry, Quinta Brunson, and Paula Pell, and featuring Tiago Martinez, Giancarlo Esposito, America Ferrera, Bowen Yang, and Tituss Burgess.\n\nDirected by Alessandro Carloni and Erica Rivinoja, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation’s first full-length feature film, The Cat in the Hat, comes to theaters and IMAX® across North America on February 27, 2026, and internationally beginning 25 February 2025. It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.",
