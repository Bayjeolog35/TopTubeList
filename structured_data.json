I provide the deeper meaning behind the ending and answer the biggest questions such as who was in the alley playing Ddakji in Los Angeles and why In-Ho returned the money to Gi-Hun's daughter.

As he rampages through the city, swallowing Sprunkis and converting them into grotesque pawns, his wrath draws the attention of Gray, a former bystander desperate to stop the destruction. While a corrupt factory owner tries to cover up the source of the contamination, Gray seeks the wisdom of a dying Mr. Tree to understand the deeper cost of their actions. As the city falls under attack, a final decision must be made: destroy the factory and risk everything, or let the monster consume them all. In the end, nature reclaims what was taken, but the price is steep.\n\nDon't forget to like, comment, subscribe and share to show your support for this channel!\n\nFollow us here for all sorts of cool stuff!\n‚ñ∫ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/gametoonsofficial/?hl=en üì∏\n‚ñ∫ TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@gametoonsofficial?lang=en üéµ\n\nSuggested rating: TV-PG\nThis video contains material not suitable for younger audiences.",

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY¬Æ Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani‚Äôs 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY¬Æ Award nod in the category of ‚ÄúBest Urban Contemporary Album.‚Äù On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 50 Best Albums of 2017‚Äù and Rolling Stone‚Äôs ‚Äú20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.‚Äù \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B‚Äôs double-platinum ‚ÄúRing,‚Äù Kyle‚Äôs platinum ‚ÄúPLAYINWITME,‚Äù and Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Me,‚Äù to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles‚Äî\"You Should Be Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDistraction,‚Äù for which she received her second GRAMMY¬Æ nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles‚Äî‚ÄúGangsta,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù [feat. Chance the Rapper], ‚ÄúCRZY,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNights Like This‚Äù [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the ‚ÄúRule Breaker Award‚Äù as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019‚Äôs chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù and ‚ÄúEverybody Business.‚Äù In the end, you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs on Kehlani‚Äôs mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt.\n\n#Kehlani #Folded #OfficialMusicVideo",
