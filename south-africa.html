    "description": "Earlier this year, EWN sat down with KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, to discuss IPID’s investigation into his involvement in the arrest of a correctional services official in northern KZN. During the interview, Mkhwanazi spoke in detail about an individual from the North West, known as “Brown Mogotsi,” who claims to be a close associate of Police Minister Senzo Mchunu. KZN’s top cop described how Mogotsi contacted him and began meddling in police matters, fueling tensions within the organisation’s hierarchy in September last year.",

It's a chaotic mix of chaos, comedy, and surprising moments of heart. ❤️\r\rWhether you're here for the action, the laughs, or the nostalgia of early 2000s superhero films, this scene is a must-watch.

<p><strong>What is TopTubeList?</strong><br>
    TopTubeList helps you quickly see what people are watching on YouTube. You can explore videos by continent or country. No clutter, no fancy talk. Just a clean snapshot of the most viewed videos — updated every 3 hours.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did we build this site?</strong><br>
    My wife was in the kitchen cooking. My mission was clear: to answer that sacred question… <em>“What should we watch while eating?”</em><br>
    Then suddenly, I found myself thinking: <em>“What do other couples watch during dinner?”</em> So, like anyone else, I turned to Google.</p>

    <p><strong>And what did I find?</strong><br>
    “Most watched videos in June”…<br>
    “Top videos of 2025”…<br>
    Basically, just a highlight reel of the past.<br>
    But I wasn’t looking for nostalgia — I wanted to know what’s trending <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

    <p>That day, we may not have found the perfect video to watch...<br>
    But I realized we weren’t alone.<br>
    There must be thousands of people wondering the exact same thing.<br>
    And that’s when the idea of TopTubeList was born.</p>

    <p><strong>And the cherry on top?</strong><br>
    For creators who make “compilation videos” using trending clips, this site is basically a goldmine.</p>

    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
    Every 3 hours, we pull the most popular videos using YouTube’s official Data API. Then we sort them by country and continent, so you can easily see what’s trending anywhere in the world.</p>

    <p><strong>This is TopTubeList.</strong><br>
    If it’s trending, chances are… we’ve already listed it. 😉</p>
