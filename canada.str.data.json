So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 our 112th country!\n3:08 boarding our boat\n4:00 our room tours\n7:09 boat layout\n10:00 first sunset & meal onboard\n14:50 emotional morning‚Ä¶\n18:15 nate‚Äôs big moment!!!\n23:03 kara‚Äôs first elephant babies!!!\n26:39 afternoon onboard\n28:42 crocs, hippos, baboons, more elephants\n33:11 day 3\n34:53 last and BEST floating game drive\n35:38 elephant charge!\n36:40 swimming elephants and hippos!",

    "description": "Bobby Carter | July 11, 2025\nAfter a 16-year hiatus and with no go-to band in place, Clipse's Tiny Desk took lots of time to piece together. At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

The pair talked to Access Hollywood after their shocking elimination and confirmed they will continue to date outside the villa. The two also shut down rumors that they were dating before they got on the show. Ace and Chelley also weighed in on if they think Nic and Olandria actually have a romantic spark and revealed if they think fellow islanders had ulterior motives when voting people out. Plus, Ace chimed in on rumors that he's the \"mayor\" of \"Love Island\" and confirmed his actual height. New episodes of \"Love Island USA\" stream Thursdays to Tuesdays on Peacock.",

    "description": "Roll up, roll up! It‚Äôs the much-requested ‚ÄòThe Amazing Digital Circus‚Äô song! A show about bunch of people trapped in a circus-themed VR game with a sinister undertone? This was inevitable really‚Ä¶\nI‚Äôve been a bit reluctant to do songs about animations and TV shows in the past, not just because video games are my comfortable niche, but because part of the fun is taking the world of the video game and trying to recreate it in live-action or animation. I was worried that an animation about‚Ä¶ well, an animation, wouldn‚Äôt be particularly transformative, and might seem just like a worse version of the original media. But I hope you‚Äôll agree that the talented team at @HibernateStudios  knocked it out the park and made something that fits beautifully into the world of TADC!\nYou may know Hibernate from their Minecraft animations for @danbull  and they also did the CG portions of Divide! for us last year. If you love this video as much I do, be sure to hop over to their channel and let them know! I‚Äôd love to work with them again soon!\nThanks to the amazing TADC voice-actors that lended their voices to our silly little project, we‚Äôre thrilled to have them! But in case it wasn‚Äôt apparent from the self-insert character, that doesn‚Äôt make this an official TADC video - just a fan project.
