    "description": "Bobby Carter | July 11, 2025\nAfter a 16-year hiatus and with no go-to band in place, Clipse's Tiny Desk took lots of time to piece together. At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

'The attention Kelly is getting feels unfair,' one source says. 'One of the best things about Kelly is, she's a real person without a huge ego. She's had a lot going on in her personal life, and is doing her best to balance it all with her duties at [her talk] show (which is on hiatus right now, so not a factor). She's got to be a mom first, which a majority of the staff understands. She's been through a lot in the last couple years, but shows up with a good attitude, ready to do her best.'",
