Led by the reluctant hero Captain Zoom, the team searches for young recruits who might save the world—or at least survive training camp! 😄\r\rWatch as each kid reveals their quirky and sometimes unpredictable powers. Some impress, some cause a few laughs (and minor explosions), but all of them have something special. It's a chaotic mix of chaos, comedy, and surprising moments of heart. ❤️\r\rWhether you're here for the action, the laughs, or the nostalgia of early 2000s superhero films, this scene is a must-watch. Don’t forget to like 👍, comment 🗨️, and subscribe for more Zoom Academy highlights and superhero throwbacks! 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️",

Lady failed to yield and i couldnt brake in time, she was deemed 100% at fault and i am currently working on getting physical and motorcycle damages taken care of but the Z is most likely totaled. But thank god i was able to walk away with just a broken arm, gopro saved me from slamming my helmet on to the ground. No road rash or any other injuries. This happened in Riverview FL.\"",
