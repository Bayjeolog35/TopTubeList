    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?\n\nFrom Oscar¬Æ winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).\n\nFormer college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football‚Äôs annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.\n\nJust when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah‚Äôs isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam‚Äôs training accelerates, Isaiah‚Äôs charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his prot√©g√© down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.\n\nThe film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.\n\nHIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw‚Äôs Kate Oh.\n\nFollow HIM on socials: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/himmovie/\nhttps://twitter.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.himmovie.com/\n \nGenre:‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãHorror \nCast:‚ÄãMarlon Wayans, Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, Tim Heidecker, Jim Jefferies \nDirector:‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãJustin Tipping\nScreenplay by:‚ÄãZack Akers & Skip Bronkie and Justin Tipping \nProducers: ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãIan Cooper, Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld, Jamal M.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
