Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY¬Æ Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani‚Äôs 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY¬Æ Award nod in the category of ‚ÄúBest Urban Contemporary Album.‚Äù On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe 50 Best Albums of 2017‚Äù and Rolling Stone‚Äôs ‚Äú20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.‚Äù \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B‚Äôs double-platinum ‚ÄúRing,‚Äù Kyle‚Äôs platinum ‚ÄúPLAYINWITME,‚Äù and Justin Bieber‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Me,‚Äù to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles‚Äî\"You Should Be Here,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDistraction,‚Äù for which she received her second GRAMMY¬Æ nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles‚Äî‚ÄúGangsta,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Way‚Äù [feat. Chance the Rapper], ‚ÄúCRZY,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNights Like This‚Äù [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the ‚ÄúRule Breaker Award‚Äù as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019‚Äôs chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù and ‚ÄúEverybody Business.‚Äù In the end, you‚Äôll know exactly what‚Äôs on Kehlani‚Äôs mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt.\n\n#Kehlani #unFolded #OfficialAcapellaVideo",

    "description": "üßõ Half human, half vampire, you know his name ‚Äî Blade. \n \nAlmost a century ago, Eric Brooks was born of two worlds: the light of his mother's embrace and the dark of the vampire that attacked her. After embracing his existence as a dhampir, he became the Daywalker, the ultimate vampire hunter, combining unmatched combat skills and unwavering supernatural abilities. \n \nWhen Dracula reigned over New York City, it was none other than Blade who confronted him first. By then, however, it was too late. Dracula had mastered the almighty power of Chronovium, defeating the Daywalker and imprisoning him within the castle dungeon. \n \nAfter Dracula's fall, Blade was sent to Wakanda to recover, but his story is far from over.
