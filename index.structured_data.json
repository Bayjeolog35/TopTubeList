'The attention Kelly is getting feels unfair,' one source says. 'One of the best things about Kelly is, she's a real person without a huge ego. She's had a lot going on in her personal life, and is doing her best to balance it all with her duties at [her talk] show (which is on hiatus right now, so not a factor). She's got to be a mom first, which a majority of the staff understands. She's been through a lot in the last couple years, but shows up with a good attitude, ready to do her best.'",
