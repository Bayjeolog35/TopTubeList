ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

I did not receive any money from Manacube for making this video. \n2. All cubits were also purchased by me EXCEPT for the cubits used in the final giveaway. I don't show this, but we ended up giving away 590 cubits three times, all of those were provided by the owner. But everything else was bought by me.",

    "description": "#Topgun3 #tomcruise #ScarlettJohansson #madsmikkelsen \n\nWatch This: \"TOP GUN 3 – Fan-Made Concept Trailer\"\n\nThe skies are calling one last time.\n\nIn this high-octane fan-made concept trailer, Top Gun 3 imagines the return of Tom Cruise as the legendary Maverick, now mentoring a new generation of elite pilots while facing the most dangerous mission of his career. With rising tensions, advanced enemy technology, and ghosts of the past resurfacing, Maverick must push beyond his limits to defend the skies he once ruled.\n\nFeaturing pulse-pounding aerial combat, emotional stakes, and the spirit of the original films, this imagined third chapter soars as a tribute to the legacy of Top Gun—where courage, speed, and sacrifice collide at Mach 10.\n\nLegends don’t fade. They fly.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis is a fan-made concept trailer created purely for entertainment purposes. It is a non-commercial project with no affiliation to Paramount Pictures, Tom Cruise, or any official Top Gun production. All rights to Top Gun and related characters belong to their respective owners.\n\nAlong with fan-made trailers, I also share movie reviews, news, and updates from the world of entertainment.
