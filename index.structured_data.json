    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?\n\nFrom Oscar® winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).\n\nFormer college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.\n\nJust when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.\n\nThe film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.\n\nHIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw’s Kate Oh.\n\nFollow HIM on socials: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/himmovie/\nhttps://twitter.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.himmovie.com/\n \nGenre:​​​​Horror \nCast:​Marlon Wayans, Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, Tim Heidecker, Jim Jefferies \nDirector:​​​Justin Tipping\nScreenplay by:​Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie and Justin Tipping \nProducers: ​​​Ian Cooper, Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld, Jamal M.

Same fearless mission.\n\nIn this action-packed fan-made concept trailer, Charlie's Angels: Reboot imagines a bold new chapter in the legendary franchise. Scarlett Johansson, Charlize Theron, and Angelina Jolie unite as a powerhouse trio of elite operatives — recruited by a new generation of Charlie to take on global threats with brains, beauty, and blistering combat skills.\n\nWhen a covert tech weapon falls into the wrong hands, the Angels must race against time across continents, unravel a deadly conspiracy, and prove that this sisterhood is more unstoppable than ever.\n\nWith explosive action, stylish espionage, and fierce female energy, this trailer pays homage to the legacy of Charlie’s Angels while imagining a high-stakes, modern reboot for a new era.\n\nThey don’t just follow orders. They rewrite the mission.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis is a fan-made concept trailer created purely for entertainment purposes. It is a non-commercial project with no affiliation to Columbia Pictures, Sony, or any official production of Charlie’s Angels.

That starts with ICE-Q 2.0, now powered by NHL EDGE data, so your favorite superstars think, move, and play like their on-ice selves. Data-informed Attributes and Tendencies make star players perform in true-to-life fashion, with their playstyles and decision-making game-aware and impactful. A fine-tuned and enhanced arsenal of 28 X-Factors spans five different categories and is driven by unique animations, tactical gameplay outcomes, and tiers of impact, turning each into a formidable on-ice weapon. Superstars now truly feel like superstars.\n\nThe all-new Goalie Crease Control System brings an upgraded awareness between the posts with new close-range and reflex saves that allow for readjustments in reaction to puck deflections, poke checks, and improved AI positioning, giving goalies increased control over the blue paint. In a redesigned Be A Pro mode, each choice you make impacts your career, as you live out the authentic hockey journey from rookie to superstar, with fresh storylines, characters, challenges, and cut scenes.\nConditions & restrictions apply.
