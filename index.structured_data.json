This video has been in the works for a long time, and I hope everyone can watch in it's entirety. Nearly three years ago I inadvertently quit my main platform where I was making content, and ever since then, I‚Äôve been working on a lot of projects which I am incredibly proud of.\n\nToday, I want to announce my biggest project yet.\n\nDababel.\n\nThis is a project which I hold very dear to my heart, not because of what it is, but because of what it represents to me. I was born and raised in Mexico, my native language is Spanish - and this gave me the opportunity to experience what it was like to be in another country and not know the language. Throughout my life and my career I‚Äôve noticed how prevalent language barriers are - no matter where you are. And Dababel is a project with the objective to help people move beyond this barrier, which has existed since the beginning of time.\n\nThis is a project for you. This is a project for everyone.\n\nDABABEL IS FOR THE WORLD. \n\nThank you for all the support, and I hope you enjoy Dababel. To my global communities, to my new viewers and old, thank you for everything!",
