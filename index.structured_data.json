Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.\n\nWatch on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/81297917\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

    "description": "MY BROTHER IS HOME!! 😭✈️ Emotional Missionary Homecoming After 2 Years\n\nAfter two years away, Brock is finally HOME!! He spent the last year and a half serving in Boston, Massachusetts, and this vlog captures the unforgettable moments leading up to his return. From packing his (very heavy) bags and saying goodbye to mission friends, to getting paired with a final companion—his journey back was emotional and full of meaning.\n\nBack at home, I was getting everything ready for his arrival—stocking the pantry (per Brock’s special request), grabbing some of his favorite foods, and prepping the house for a big surprise. We stayed up late making posters (yes, including a hilarious “marry me” one and some Fortnite-themed signs 😂) and decorated everything to make his homecoming extra special.\n\nHe landed in Salt Lake City, and the moment he walked through those airport doors… we were all in tears. Our mom cried, and the biggest surprise of all—his girlfriend was there to meet him even though he thought she’d still be out of town 👀\n\nOnce we got home, Brock saw his room for the first time, opened his welcome-back gift basket, and we wrapped up the perfect day with a Bees baseball game as a family. It was one of those days we’ll never forget. \n\nVideo’s/Things mentioned: \n- Amazon Storefront (Favorite products): https://amzlink.to/az02wwSvCTCHc\n- LTK (Where we link our outfits): https://www.shopltk.com/explore/brockandboston\n- Discount Codes: https://shopmy.us/brockandboston\n\nI dare you to tap me: https://brockandboston.com/links/\n\nMeet Brock and Boston:\nWhat’s up!!! We are twin brothers from Salt Lake City, Utah that recently moved to Nashville, Tennessee. We started doing social media back in 2016 and have been posting ever since. We love sharing our life with everyone! On our channel, we do a mix of a lot of things like challenges, vlogs, pranks, and more! \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSocial Media Accounts:\n\nInstagram: @brockandbostonofficial \n\nTikTok: @brockandboston \n\nTwitter: @brockandboston\n\nFacebook: @brockandboston \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOur family’s channels:\n\nBrock and Boston Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE7S... \n\nAlyssa & Dallin: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKW... \n\n\nThe Mikesell Family: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZN... \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ&A: \n\nAre you twins?

Also thank you so much to MLB for giving us credentialed access to talk to the games biggest stars on the biggest stage. Finally, thank you to you all for your continued support ❤️ none of this is possible without you guys and we are so grateful to be able to go on these adventures because of you all.
