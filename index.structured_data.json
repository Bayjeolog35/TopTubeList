The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It‚Äôs the only channel where you‚Äôll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

    "description": "Teaming up with @RandySantel to take on the 30\" Gridiron Team Pizza Challenge at End Zone Pizza in Augusta, Maine! Teams of 2 have just 45 minutes to finish a 30\" one-topping pizza in order to earn their meal for free, a groovy t-shirt, $200 cash, and a spot up on the wall of fame! Hungry diners may also attempt this solo and are granted a 90 minute time limit. Randy and I were a couple of silly gooses, however, and tried to be the first team to finish with several toppings (we each ordered specialty pizzas; I opted for the Hawaiian, Randy opted for the Philly Cheesesteak). Could we make history?!\n***\nRP Strength Code: KILOS\nRP Diet App Link: https://rp.app/diet/code/KILOS\nRP Hypertrophy App Link: https://rp.app/hypertrophy/code/KILOS\n***\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/katinaeatskilos/\nWEBSITE: https://www.katinaeatskilos.com\n***\nAbout Me:\nI'm a 5'2 former women's physique bodybuilder on a mission to sample delicious foods from around the world! I tackle restaurant challenges, sample new food menus, and explore the unique eats in various cities. To balance out the calorie intake of weekly food challenges, I continue to pursue my love of fitness through bodybuilding, running, and spinning. \n\nFAQ:\n**How do you not get fat?** \nPlease check out my \"Daily Diet\" Playlist Here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjzJq-PMUB7ovX5rYVzA1GITfvCtq3P3\n\n**Why do you shake so much?**\nI have a genetic condition known as \"non-essential tremors\". That in combination with nerves, being hungry with lowered blood sugar, and a deep and profound love affair with caffeine, makes for a rather jittery start to a challenge.\n\n**Are you and Randy married?** \nNo, not yet! We got engaged on December 1, 2024 though and are excited for the future!",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. üòäüé•üåé Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 our 112th country!\n3:08 boarding our boat\n4:00 our room tours\n7:09 boat layout\n10:00 first sunset & meal onboard\n14:50 emotional morning‚Ä¶\n18:15 nate‚Äôs big moment!!!\n23:03 kara‚Äôs first elephant babies!!!\n26:39 afternoon onboard\n28:42 crocs, hippos, baboons, more elephants\n33:11 day 3\n34:53 last and BEST floating game drive\n35:38 elephant charge!\n36:40 swimming elephants and hippos!",
