    "description": "MY BROTHER IS HOME!! üò≠‚úàÔ∏è Emotional Missionary Homecoming After 2 Years\n\nAfter two years away, Brock is finally HOME!! He spent the last year and a half serving in Boston, Massachusetts, and this vlog captures the unforgettable moments leading up to his return. From packing his (very heavy) bags and saying goodbye to mission friends, to getting paired with a final companion‚Äîhis journey back was emotional and full of meaning.\n\nBack at home, I was getting everything ready for his arrival‚Äîstocking the pantry (per Brock‚Äôs special request), grabbing some of his favorite foods, and prepping the house for a big surprise. We stayed up late making posters (yes, including a hilarious ‚Äúmarry me‚Äù one and some Fortnite-themed signs üòÇ) and decorated everything to make his homecoming extra special.\n\nHe landed in Salt Lake City, and the moment he walked through those airport doors‚Ä¶ we were all in tears. Our mom cried, and the biggest surprise of all‚Äîhis girlfriend was there to meet him even though he thought she‚Äôd still be out of town üëÄ\n\nOnce we got home, Brock saw his room for the first time, opened his welcome-back gift basket, and we wrapped up the perfect day with a Bees baseball game as a family. It was one of those days we‚Äôll never forget. \n\nVideo‚Äôs/Things mentioned: \n- Amazon Storefront (Favorite products): https://amzlink.to/az02wwSvCTCHc\n- LTK (Where we link our outfits): https://www.shopltk.com/explore/brockandboston\n- Discount Codes: https://shopmy.us/brockandboston\n\nI dare you to tap me: https://brockandboston.com/links/\n\nMeet Brock and Boston:\nWhat‚Äôs up!!! We are twin brothers from Salt Lake City, Utah that recently moved to Nashville, Tennessee. We started doing social media back in 2016 and have been posting ever since. We love sharing our life with everyone! On our channel, we do a mix of a lot of things like challenges, vlogs, pranks, and more! \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSocial Media Accounts:\n\nInstagram: @brockandbostonofficial \n\nTikTok: @brockandboston \n\nTwitter: @brockandboston\n\nFacebook: @brockandboston \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nOur family‚Äôs channels:\n\nBrock and Boston Shorts: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE7S... \n\nAlyssa & Dallin: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKW... \n\n\nThe Mikesell Family: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZN... \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ&A: \n\nAre you twins?
