    "description": "Every battle has led to this.\n\nMore about Stranger Things 5:\nThe fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished ‚Äî his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will‚Äôs disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming ‚Äî and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they‚Äôve faced before. To end this nightmare, they‚Äôll need everyone ‚Äî the full party ‚Äî standing together, one last time.\n\nWatch on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/81297917\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

    "description": "Fat Joe and Jadakiss are joined by Pusha T and Malice, a.k.a. Clipse, to dive into their rap careers and their new album ‚ÄòLet God Sort Em Out.‚Äô They discuss how they originally linked up with super producer Pharrell Williams and how he has been a huge part of their sound from the very beginning. Next, Pusha and Malice break down why they left Def Jam over the Kendrick Lamar track on their new album, explaining that in no way is it a beef record, but that politics and optics were the real reason Def Jam had a problem with it. They also thank Jay-Z and Roc Nation for stepping up to do the distribution and explain why they decided that the first track be \"The Birds Don't Sing,‚Äù a tribute to their late mother and father, featuring John Legend.\n(Recorded on June 17, 2025)\n\nFollow Joe and Jada on social media: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/joeandjada\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@joeandjada?lang=en\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JoeAndJada\nhttps://www.x.com/JoeAndJada\n\nSubscribe to Fat Joe and Jadakiss on YouTube:\nFat Joe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdq3IqQwiWQfjdjwxTLO-qQ\nJadakiss: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB97I4RY2RigxjSF6b9DkQ",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
