ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

    "name": "Wednesday: Season 2 | Final Trailer | Netflix Series | Jenna Ortega | Teaser PRO's Concept Version",
    "description": "#wednesday #netflix \n\nWatch the official trailer for Wednesday Season 2. Part 1 is coming on August 6th. Part 2 is coming on September 3rd. Only on Netflix.\n\nWednesday is an American supernatural mystery comedy television series based on the character Wednesday Addams by Charles Addams\n\nThis trailer is a creative concept mashup that captures how I imagine a final trailer of 'Wednesday: Season 2' might look and feel.\n◖ An artistic idea By Teaser PRO  ◗\nMade/Edited  By Teaser PRO (Music, SFX, VFX, Art )\n\nMore Trailers\n\n◖Squid Game: USA - Season 4 ◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcjjPpd5s1A\n\n◖ Spider-Man: Brand New Day◗\n▻ https://youtu.be/yGcXBa9lUco\n\n◖Stranger Things 5: Volume 1 ◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPFG39a_EoQ\n\n◖I AM LEGEND 2: LAST MAN ON EARTH◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTuokF7-RXA\n\n◖Harry Potter And The Cursed Child ◗\n▻ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWJepe-nxE\n____________________________________________\n\nTrailer mashups, also known as recut trailers, involve editing together various pieces of film footage (from either one or multiple movies) to create a new trailer. These mashups are often made for films that don’t exist yet, or to alter the genre of an existing movie. As derivative works, as defined by the United States Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. § 101, trailer mashups may be protected from copyright claims under the doctrine of fair use.\n___________________________________________\n\n\nWednesday” Season 2 continues the gothic, supernatural story created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, with executive production by Tim Burton. Jenna Ortega returns not only as the lead but also as a producer for the new season. The first season, which premiered on Netflix on November 23, 2022, followed Wednesday Addams as she enrolled in Nevermore Academy, developed her psychic abilities, and uncovered a local mystery involving a string of murders.\n\nIn Season 2, premiering in two parts — Part I on August 6, 2025, and Part II on September 3, 2025 — Wednesday returns to Nevermore as something of a local celebrity. But visions of her friend Enid’s death lead her to a new mission: to stop it from happening — or die trying.\n\nThis season brings a darker, more horror-leaning tone, with deeper exploration of Wednesday’s powers and the secrets of the Addams family. The school has a new principal, Barry Dort (played by Steve Buscemi), and several new cast members join, including Lady Gaga as a new teacher, Yoanna Lumi as Wednesday’s ancestor Hester Frump, Billy Piper, Thandiwe Newton, and Haley Joel Osment as a villain known as “The Kansas Stripper.”\n\nThere’s more family drama this time too — especially tension between Wednesday and her mother Morticia — and her brother Pugsley is now a student at Nevermore, possibly showing signs of supernatural abilities himself.",

(Eh, eh, eh)\n\n[Verso 4]\nQué bonito chingarte y más rico y de noche\nUn palito en el aire y privado pa' Londres\nDiferentes mujeres de varios sabores\nNomás no te me aloques\nMujeriego y coqueto, tengo mil amores\nDe hace tiempo te busco, mas no sé ni en dónde\nSi me quieres, tendrás que aguantar los rumores\nNomás no te me aloques\n\n[Outro]\nEy\nFuerza Regida\nJajaja\n¿Ah?\nJaja\n\n#FuerzaRegida #TuSancho",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",
