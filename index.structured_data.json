ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

    "description": "A highly realistic, unerringly brutal tactical first-person shooter, that too with a good single-player component, is a tough call. Now try finding one inspired by one of the greatest of all time. the SWAT series, while standing out on its own.\n\nDespite these heavy expectations and a somewhat repetitive campaign, Void Interactive's Ready or Not surprisingly steps up. As the leader of D Platoon, players embark on a harrowing journey through various missions, from robberies and busts to shootouts in deadly cabins rigged with traps. The gunplay is realistic, the tactics feel sound, and the presentation, especially the environments, is gritty and real.\n\nSome iffy AI and a somewhat samey gameplay loop tend to bog things down, but thankfully, there's also co-op, where up to five players can team together for some chaotic fun. While Ready or Not won't revolutionize the genre, it does deserve some credit for going beyond simply paying tribute and delivering a worthwhile experience, even on consoles.",
