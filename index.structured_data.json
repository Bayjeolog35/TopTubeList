Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.\n\nWatch on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/81297917\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

You would think that the idea of border control would make residents feel safe - but it's pumped fear into our communities. \n\nThey're going after people that make our city beautiful. People who put food in our supermarkets, take care of other people's kids, work two to three jobs so they can take care of their families. It breaks my heart. \n\nI wanted to make this video to change the vibe and celebrate the folks that make our cities great. The very same people who are being disregarded, dehumanized, and demoralized. \n\nThank you for your contributions. Thank you for your work. We will get through this. \n\nProduction Company: Clash of The Artistic Minds\nExecutive Producer: Sterling Hampton IV\nDirectors: will.i.am & Sterling Hampton IV \n\nProducer: Sterling Hampton IV\nCo-producer: Sabrina Lassegue\nCinematographer: Adam Shattuck \nSteadicam Op: Matias Wajner\nCamera Op: Sterling Hampton IV \nAC: Raquel Wajner\nPA: Toby Ilogu\nEditors: Stefano Lee, Sterling Hampton IV\nVFX Company: Secret Level, Jason Zada\nColorist: Kinan Chabani \n\nManagement: Polo Molina & Seth Friedman \n\nCasting: Carlos Ayala & Fabian Alomar\n\nSecond Unit Interview: FYI \nProducer: Sean Kantrowitz \nCamera Op: Kevin Wilson \nEditors: Daniel Khat, Sean Kantrowitz \nGraphics: Frankie Sandoval \n\nStylist: Brookelyn Styles \nBTS Photography: Eli Soto \n\n#william #taboo #eastla #losangeles",
