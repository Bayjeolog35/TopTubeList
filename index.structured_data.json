    "description": "We‚Äôre not done with you. #FNAF2movie in theaters December 5.\n\n--\n\nThey‚Äôre not just at Freddy‚Äôs anymore. \n \nIn 2023, Blumhouse‚Äôs box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town‚Äôs first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike‚Äôs 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy‚Äôs, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy‚Äôs 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy‚Äôs film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

wasn‚Äôt braced and kissed my face\nWith the scope of my rifle\nI had shot it from a blind as in you‚Äôd be blind not to see\nThat there‚Äôs a man in the doorway\nOf a mother fucking mansion\nAiming at the feeder where you‚Äôd sat to take a feast\nThat‚Äôs what I said that‚Äôs what I did\nAnd it did not cut one corner\nAs I carved that fat neck mother right down to the bone\nI let him hang for several days\nAnd then I cut off hide and scriffin‚Äô\nI cut it thin then throw it in a tupperware to soak\nFried some pieces while I worked\nIt tasted like I made it\nFried in Wagner casted butter in a quiet country place\nWith albums gold and platinum\nOverflowing to the ceiling\nEatin big time is a feelin‚Äô with the friends that I have made\nKeep my time on my Weiss\nYa goddamn right I‚Äôm flexing\nCause a thousand dollar watch is fine enough flex for me\nHave you ever got to hold and blow a thousand fucking dollars\nIt runs for 40 hours and then it winds itself to sleep\nIt‚Äôs fought for like a bitch and it‚Äôs a bitch to keep it goin‚Äô\nWhen they ain‚Äôt nobody knowin‚Äô\nAny prayer you‚Äôve ever sang\nSee me now I‚Äôm on the sow\nAnd I‚Äôm riding to your city\nEatin big time ain‚Äôt she pretty ain‚Äôt she witty ain‚Äôt she great\nAin‚Äôt she great ain‚Äôt she grand\nIn my world she‚Äôs irreplaceable\nI‚Äôm her surfboard in the kitchen\nMy blessings come in waves\nShe‚Äôs my rebirth she‚Äôs my lemonade\nMy gravy and my biscuits\nMama I‚Äôve been out there huntin‚Äô Imma need you to make a plate\nShe pets my head and whispers ‚ÄúYou poor thing you must be famished‚Äù\nI just knew that this would happen I got all the fixins made\nI‚Äôll get tick full ‚Äòfore I ever pull myself off of this table\nEatin big time ain‚Äôt she pretty just rollin‚Äô in the shade\nEatin big time in the holler ain‚Äôt it lovely ain‚Äôt it great\n\nCredits:\nDirected by James Mackel\nCreative Director: Emily Cox\nCo-Direction: Sammy McEntire\nProduction Company: Adele Drive\nExecutive
