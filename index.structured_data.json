    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?\n\nFrom Oscar® winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).\n\nFormer college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.\n\nJust when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.\n\nThe film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.\n\nHIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw’s Kate Oh.\n\nFollow HIM on socials: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/himmovie/\nhttps://twitter.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.himmovie.com/\n \nGenre:​​​​Horror \nCast:​Marlon Wayans, Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, Tim Heidecker, Jim Jefferies \nDirector:​​​Justin Tipping\nScreenplay by:​Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie and Justin Tipping \nProducers: ​​​Ian Cooper, Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld, Jamal M.

When Miami Metro’s Angel Batista (David Zayas) arrives with questions, Dexter realizes his past is catching up to him fast. As father and son navigate their own darkness in the city that never sleeps, they soon find themselves deeper than they ever imagined—and that the only way out is together.\n\nStarring: Michael C.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Hoping to solve the mystery of her father's disappearance, Croft embarks on a perilous journey to his last-known destination -- a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. The stakes couldn't be higher as Lara must rely on her sharp mind, blind faith and stubborn spirit to venture into the unknown.",

    "description": "NO NONSENSE GUIDE TO THE RECKONING EASTER EGG IN BLACK OPS 6 ZOMBIES!\n💦🪣Need the sprinklers to go off on command? In the spawn/reception area, look into the window to the right of the security room. There's a smoke detector on the ceiling behind that window. Throw a molotov and the alarm will go off, setting off the sprinkler!\n💳🧬Can't go to bossfight? You need the keycard AND to use it on the refrigerator nearby the wife & child blue tube in Mutant Research. Pick up the DNA.\n🟣🔒Can't find purple objects OR the modified Kazimirs? There's a box on every level, but the purple objects will only spawn in Tower 1. There's 3 purple items in the Director's Office/Executive area, 2 in Mutant Research, 1 in Quantum, 1 in Reception/spawn.\n🔫🧵Need a good scorestreak vs boss? Death Machine does a bunch of damage!\n🦾🤖You can find more arms during the Forsaken fight! Just leave him alive and lots of Kommando Klaus will spawn. You also don't need all Klaus parts to turn him on. So if you're missing an arm but Uber Klaus spawns, activate the boy Klaus anyways.\n🎰🏆SAM Trial not spawning? Literally just stay nearby for as many rounds as possible. There may be another SAM Trial spawned on the map, so find it and activate it. Unsure of other fixes.\n\n👕 NO NONSENSE MERCH: http://milomerch.com\n🔥 AKT Deodorant: https://tidd.ly/3SuMeqX\n\n🥞 Follow Milo here:\n🎮 Twitch: http://twitch.tv/MrRoflWaffles\n🐦 Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrRoflWaffles\n📸 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/milo_bc/\n🧑 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@mrroflwaffles\n💻 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/mrroflwaffles/\n📘 FaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/MrRoflWaffles\n📸 Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/mrrw",
