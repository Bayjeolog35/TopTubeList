    "description": "What would you sacrifice to become the greatest of all time?\n\nFrom Oscar® winner Jordan Peele and Monkeypaw Productions, producers of the landmark horror films Get Out, Us, Candyman and Nope, comes a chilling journey into the inner sanctum of fame, idolatry and the pursuit of excellence at any cost, featuring an electrifying dramatic performance from Marlon Wayans (Air, Respect).\n\nFormer college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) plays Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.\n\nJust when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.\n\nThe film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.\n\nHIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping. The film is produced by Ian Cooper (Nope, Us), Jordan Peele (Candyman, BlacKkKlansman), Win Rosenfeld (Candyman, Lovecraft Country) and Jamal M. Watson (Hala, Sprinter) for Monkeypaw Productions and is executive produced by David Kern and Monkeypaw’s Kate Oh.\n\nFollow HIM on socials: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/himmovie/\nhttps://twitter.com/himmovie/\nhttps://www.himmovie.com/\n \nGenre:​​​​Horror \nCast:​Marlon Wayans, Tyriq Withers, Julia Fox, Tim Heidecker, Jim Jefferies \nDirector:​​​Justin Tipping\nScreenplay by:​Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie and Justin Tipping \nProducers: ​​​Ian Cooper, Jordan Peele, Win Rosenfeld, Jamal M.

Ella Langley: https://symphony.to/bigxthaplug/hell-at-night\n\nLyrics:\nHeartbreak’s a funny thing\nHow it makes you think\nWhat it makes you want\n\nWhy, when it ends, us getting revenge\nSounds better than moving on\n\nAnd I’d love to live and let live\nLet it go, forgive and forget\nHolding a grudge ain’t what I want to do\nBut when it comes to you\n\nI hope it's hell at night\nStraight to the morning\nI hope you close your eyes\nAnd just can’t ignore it\n’Cause it’s too damn loud\nTossing and turning\nI hope it's hell at night\nAnd my memory’s burning, burning\n\nAye\nI hope you hear me every time you play a song\nI hope you meet the right person but y’all never get along\nI hope you know you ain’t right, and you so good at burning bridges\nI hope you finally find some love and every day he hurt your feelings\nI hope you, I hope you turn your heater on and it blows cold\nI hope you leave your car running at the store and it get stolen\nI hope you have a nightmare every single day of your life\nI hope you have a bad morning, and one hell of a night\n\nI hope it's hell at night\nStraight to the morning\nI hope you close your eyes\nAnd just can’t ignore it\n’Cause it’s too damn loud\nTossing and turning\nI hope it's hell at night\nAnd my memory’s burning, burning\n\nAye\nI hope you see me every time you close your eyes\nAnd every time you think about me, you hear thunder in the sky\nI’m out the way, and by the way, I hope you lived and what you learned\nI hope you go deep into the woods, and you make the wrong turn\nI hope it burns you up\n\nLike a cigarette\nLike a last call shot\nStraight to the head\nI hope stare at the wall\nOr an old home screen\nKind of hopin’ I call\n’Cause you can’t call me\n\nI hope it's hell at night\nStraight to the morning\nI hope you close your eyes\nAnd just can’t ignore it\n’Cause it’s too damn loud\nTossing and turning\nI hope it's hell at night\nAnd my memory’s burning, burning\n\n\nFollow BigXthaPlug:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bigxthaplug\nhttps://twitter.com/BigXthaPluggh\nttps://www.tiktok.com/@bigxthaplug_\nhttps://www.facebook.com/p/bigxthaplug-100063805581381/\nhttps://www.bigxthaplugofficial.com/\nEverything BigX: https://bigxthaplug.komi.io/\n\n#BigXthaPlug #EllaLangley #HellAtNight #IHOPEYOUREHAPPY",
