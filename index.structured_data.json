ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

    "description": "Before anything else, I just want to say congratulations to one of my closest friends @Bluffinbob on hitting 500,000 Subscribers.  Please make sure you watch his video on his channel, before this one.  With that in mind, after the boys risked $100,000 yesterday... we are BACK at the Casino firing $40,000 MORE!  Can we win HUGE, or will we get absolutely SMOKED? Thank you all so much for liking, subscribing, and dropping your thoughts in the comments. Even if you‚Äôre roasting me‚ÄîI still love you. You‚Äôre all beautiful, and I truly appreciate every single one of you for riding along on this crazy journey.  Wish me luck, and I‚Äôll see you in the next one! Let‚Äôs go to war.\n\nBrettski stood at the edge of the high-limit pit, heart pounding like a war drum. Behind him: Robby, Bluff, and their newest ally‚ÄîNick, a smooth-talking poker degenerate from New Jersey they‚Äôd met the night before. The sting of losing $100,000 still hung in the air like cigarette smoke. But today? Vengeance.\n\nEach of them peeled off ten grand in cash, stacking it into a single pile.\n\n‚ÄúForty grand,‚Äù Brettski muttered. ‚ÄúOne shot to flip this.‚Äù\n\nBluff raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDragon Baccarat,‚Äù said Nick, cracking his knuckles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got the highest variance. We either double up‚Ä¶ or go home in silence.‚Äù\n\nThe dealer gave a slow nod as they sat down. First hand: Player wins. They were up five grand instantly.\n\nSecond hand: Banker wins. Back to square one.\n\nThe next ten minutes were a blur‚Äîbets flying, adrenaline rising, Nick screaming ‚ÄúParlay!‚Äù after every win. They built it up to $68,000‚Äîalmost there.\n\nThen Robby saw it.\n\n‚Äú$1,000 side bet‚ÄîPlayer pair,‚Äù he whispered.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it,‚Äù Brettski warned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how the devil gets you.‚Äù\n\nRobby did it anyway. The cards hit: Player‚Äî7 of hearts, 7 of diamonds.\n\nThe pit roared. The side bet paid out 11-to-1.\n\nThey hit $79,000.\n\n‚ÄúTwenty-one grand away,‚Äù Bluff grinned. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs finish this.‚Äù\n\nBut that‚Äôs when the pit boss stepped in.\n\n‚ÄúGentlemen, upstairs guests would like a word,‚Äù he said, voice calm but cold. ‚ÄúThey've been watching your little comeback. They want to offer you a shortcut to six figures.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat kind of shortcut?‚Äù Nick asked.\n\nThe pit boss gestured to the service elevator in the back, guarded by two men in suits.\n\n‚ÄúHigh-stakes poker. No cameras. One hand. Double or nothing.‚Äù\n\nBrettski glanced at the others.\n\n‚ÄúDo we walk away winners‚Ä¶ or take the elevator?‚Äù\n\nThe doors opened with a chime.\n\nNo one moved.\n\n#slots #blackjack #gambling #casino #baccarat #roulette\n\nWho is Brettski? Brettski is a Professional Gambler, similar to the ancient legends Vegas Matt, Bluff, DegenDalt, Mr. Hand Pay, or Lady Luck HQ! However, unlike these legends, Brettski has thousands of years of stored ancient knowledge harvested by the elders, at skills such as Slot Machines, Roulette, Blackjack, Craps, Bubble Craps, Poker, and Baccarat.  Brettski's goal as a Professional Gambler is simple: own all of Las Vegas, using funds made by Gambling.  Subscribe to support his journey in world domination.",
